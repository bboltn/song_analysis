Lean On
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each otherBut the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let goBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onWhat will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll overWhen the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let goBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onAll we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean onBlow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
