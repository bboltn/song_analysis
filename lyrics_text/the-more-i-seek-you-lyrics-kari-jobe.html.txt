The More I Seek You
The more I seek you
The more I find you
The more I found you, the more I love youI wanna sit at your feet
Drink from the cup in your hand.
Lay back against you and breath, feel your heart beat
This love is so deep, it's more than I can stand.
I melt in your peace, it's overwhelming
