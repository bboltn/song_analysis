Criminal
I dont want to close my eyes, why pretend im gonna sleep when i know damn well im gonna keep laying here wide awake for the breath you take to come back.
I cant relax, im a tiger put in my cage, cocked like a 12 gauge.
Feeling like a teenage crush, your a rush, your the habbit i can never get enough of.
Boy, what you do to me is criminal, baby when i look in those eyes, i feel like going through stop lights, looking at the cops like, i got nothing to lose.
Yeah, boy got me burning like a matchstick, take me to the edge and one step past it.
It aint right, it aint typical, boy what you do to me is criminal.
I have the right to remain silent, but there aint no way that i can.
Cause im wired like a ticking time bomb, its so wrong, but it feels right.
Tonight, your repeating like an echo, baby i cant let go, got me going clepto like a thief, yeah I'd steal, just to keep on feeling what i feel.
Boy what you do to me is criminal, baby when i look in those eyes, i feel like going through stop lights, looking at the cops like, i got nothing to lose.
