Don't know how but you did it
Made a way
Standing here not knowing how will get through this test
but holding unto faith you know best
nothing can catch you by surprise
you got this figured out and youre watching us now
but when it looks as if we cant win
you wrap us in your arm and step in
and everything we need you supply
you got this in control

when our backs were against the wall
and it looked as if it was over
you made a way
and we're standing here
only because you made a way

looking back on where we come from
because of you and nothing we've got
to deserve the love and mercy you've shown
but your grace was strong enough to pick us upand you made a way
