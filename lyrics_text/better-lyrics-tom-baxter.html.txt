Better
Our love has changed, it's not the same
And the only way to say it is say it, it's betterI can't conceal this way I feel
For all the times we spend together
Forever just gets betterSeem what I'm try to say is
You make things better
And no matter what the day is
With you here it's betterI stand by you if you stand by me
I think it's time that I reveal it
'Cause I believe it, it's betterSeem what I'm try to say is
You make things better
And no matter what the day is
If you're here it's betterOh, the more I talk to you
I'm falling in love with everything you do, ohSeem what I'm try to say is
You make things better
And no matter what the day isWith you here it's better
Oh, seem what im trying to say is
You make things, Better
And no matter what the day is
With you here, it's Better
Our love has changed, it's not the same
And the only way to say it is say it, it's better
