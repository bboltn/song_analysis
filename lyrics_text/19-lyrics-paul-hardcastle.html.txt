19
In 1965 Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war but it wasn't
It was different in many ways, as so were tose that did the fighting
In World War II the average age of the combat soldier was 26
In Vietnam he was 19
In-in-in Vietnam he was 19The shooting and fighting of the past two weeks continued today
25 miles west of Saigon
I really wasn't sure what was going onNi-ni-ni 19, 19, ni-19 19In Vietnam the combat soldier typically served
A twelve month tour of duty
But was exposed to hostile fire almost everyday
Ni-ni-ni 19, Ni-ni-ni 19Hundreds of thousands of men who saw heavy combat
In Vietnam were arrested since discharge
Their arrest rate is almost twice that of non-veterans of the same age
There are no accurate figures of how many of these men
Have been incarceratedBut a Veterans Administration study
Concludes that the greater of vets
Exposure to combat could more likely affect his chances
Of being arrested or convictedThis is one legacy of the Vietnam WarAll those who remember the war
They won't forget what they've seen
Destruction of men in their prime
Whose average was 19De-de-destruction

War, warAfter World War II the men came home together on troop ships
But the Vietnam vet often arrived home within 48 hours of jungle combat
Perhaps the most dramatic difference between
World War II and Vietnam was coming home
None of them received a hero's welcomeNone of them received a heroes welcome, none of them, none of them
Ne-ne-ne, ne-ne-ne, none of them, none of them, none of them
None of them received a hero's welcome
None of them received a hero's welcomeAccording to a Veteran's Administration study
Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered from what
Psychiatrists call
Post-Traumatic-Stress-DisorderMany vets complain of alienation, rage or guilt
Some succumb to suicidal thoughts
Eight to ten years after coming home
Almost eight hundred thousand men are still fighting the Vietnam WarDe-de-destruction

Ni-ni-ni 19, 19, ni-19 19When we came back it was different, everybody wants to know
"How'd it happened to those guys over there?
There's gotta be something wrong somewhere
We did what we had to doThere's gotta be something wrong somewhere
People wanted us to be ashamed of what it made us
Dad had no idea what he went to fight and he is now
All we want to do is come homeAll we want to do is come home
What did we do it for?
All we want to do is come home
Was it worth it
