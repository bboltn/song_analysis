No Longer Slaves
You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are goneI'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of GodFrom my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again, into your family
Your blood flows through my veinsI'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of GodI am surrounded by the arms of the Father
I am surrounded by songs of deliverance
We'll be liberated from our bondage
We're the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedomohh. ohh. ohh.You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
All my fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
So I could stand and sing
I am a child of GodYou split the sea
So I could walk right through it
All my fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
So I could stand and sing
I am a child of GodI'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
