Falling Slowly
I don't know you but I want you
All the more for that
Words fall through me and always fool me
And I can't react
And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves outTake this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You'll make it nowFalling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back
Moods that take me and erase me
And I'm painted black
You have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you wonTake this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You'll make it nowTake this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You'll make it nowFalling slowly sing your melody
I'll sing along
