Follow The Sun
Follow, follow the sun
and which way the wind blows
when this day is done.Breath, breath in the air.
Set your intentions.
Dream with care.Tomorrow is a new day for everyone,
a brand new moon, brand new sun.So follow, follow the sun,
the direction of the bird,
the direction of love.Breath, breath in the air,
cheerish this moment,cheerish this breath.Tomorrow is a new day for everyone,
brand new moon, brand new sun.When you feel love coming down on you,
like a heavy wave.
When you feel this crazy society,
headin' to the strand.
Take a straw to the nearest waters
and remember your place.
Many moons have risen and fallen long, long before youve came.
So which way is the wind blowin',
and what does your heart say?
So follow, follow the sun,
and which way the wind blows
when this day is done...
