Latch
(Never)You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me
Even when you're not aroundIf there are boundaries
I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe
Now I know what I have foundI feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to youI'm so encaptured
Got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored
Hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it?
You got me losing every breath
Whay did you give me
To make my heart beat out my chest?I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to youI'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I won't let go, I won't let go
I won't let go
(Never)
