Cheap Thrills
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night, and it won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's Friday night, and it won't be longTill I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, babyBaby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I love cheap thrills!
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I love cheap thrills!But I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancingCome on, come on, turn the radio on
