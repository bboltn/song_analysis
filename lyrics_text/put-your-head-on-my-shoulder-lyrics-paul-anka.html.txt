Put Your Head On My Shoulder
Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight
Show me that you love me tooPut your lips next to mine, dear
Won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in lovePeople say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way
I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush inPut your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me, tell me that you love me too.
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, baby
Put your head on... my... shoulder
