One life, one dream
One moment, one team
One youth, lights high
Thousand road blocks, one shot
One truth, no fears
One flag, oh yeah
We've been waiting for this all year
Where y'all at? we're right here![Verse 3: Nicky Jam]
Ya empezó la rumba y estamos celebrando
Todo el mundo que me levante la mano
'Tamos vivos, hay que disfrutarlo
Hoy nadie me detiene porque yo no sé parar, no, no[Chorus: Nicky Jam]

For the love, I'm a rebel I'm coming from
Every nation under the sun
Elevating their favourite song when we hit and run
You own it, you got it
The whole world it's watching
So let's get this pumping
Where y'all at? we're right there![Chorus: Nicky Jam & Era Istrefi]
Only one life to live, got so much to give
Fighting for the nation now, that is my gift
Run like a champion and win like a king
That's my only gold my everything
Living up now, nowOh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (living up now, now)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ohOh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (jealousy, ambition)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (victories, celebration)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (one love, one nation)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Ay[Outro: Era Istrefi]
