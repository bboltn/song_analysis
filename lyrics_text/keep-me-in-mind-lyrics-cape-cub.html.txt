Keep Me In Mind
The rolling ocean takes a breath
From the shoreline, I feel blessed
Take me northbound, back to home
Where I know
I see our footprints in the sand
I feel hairs raise on the back of my hand
Take me northbound, back to home
Where I know
You feel like you're alone
And you feel like something's wrong
I feel like I won't know, I won't know
So, keep me in mind
Keep me in mindThe concrete skyline comes along
I hold your picture, and now I'm gone
Take me northbound, back to home
Where I know
And you feel like you're alone
You feel like something's wrong
I feel like I won't know, I won't know
'Til I'm alone
So, keep me in mind
Keep me in mind
What I fear is something I don't know
What I fear is what they can't control
Keep me in mindKeep me in mindKeep me in mind
Keep me in mind
