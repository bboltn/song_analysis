The Birds and the Bees
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called 'Love'Let me tell ya 'bout the stars in the sky
And a girl and a guy
And the way they could kiss
On a night like thisWhen I look into your big brown eyes
It's so very plain to see
That it's time you learned about the facts of life
Starting from A to ZLet me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called 'Love'
(Yeah)When I look into your big brown eyes
It's so very plain to see
That it's time you learned about the facts of life
Starting from a to zLet me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called 'Love'Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees, 'bout the birdsAnd the bees
And the bees
And the bees
