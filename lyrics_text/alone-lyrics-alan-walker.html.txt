Alone
Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me goIf this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not aloneAnywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not aloneI know I'm not alone
I know I'm not aloneUnconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain awayIf this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not aloneAnywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not aloneI know I'm not alone
I know I'm not aloneI'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
