Stand By Your Man
Sometimes its hard to be a woman
Givin all your love to just one man
You'll have bad times and he'll have good times
Doing things that you dont understand
But if you love him you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understandAnd if you love him
Oh be proud of him
Cause after all he's just a manStand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonelyStand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep givin all the love you can
Stand by your man
