High Hopes
Next time you're found
With your chin on the ground
There a lot to be learned
So look aroundJust what makes that little old ant
Think he'll move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant, can't
Move a rubber tree plantBut he's got high hopes
He's got high hopes
He's got high apple pie
In the sky hopesSo any time you're gettin' low
'Stead of lettin' go, just remember that ant
Oops, there goes another rubber tree plant
Oops, there goes another rubber tree plant
Oops, there goes another rubber tree plantWhen troubles call
And your back's to the wall
There a lot to be learned
That wall could fallOnce there was a silly old ram
Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram, scram
He kept buttin' that dam'Cause he had high hopes
He had high hopes
He had high apple pie
In the sky hopesSo any time you're feelin' bad
'Stead of feelin' sad, just remember that ram
Oops, there goes a billion kilowatt dam
Oops, there goes a billion kilowatt dam
Oops, there goes a billion kilowatt damAll problems just a toy balloon
They'll be bursted soon, they're just bound to go pop
Oops, there goes another problem kerplop
Oops, there goes another problem kerplop
Oops, there goes another problem kerplop, kerplop
