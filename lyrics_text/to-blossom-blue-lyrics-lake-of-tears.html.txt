To Blossom Blue
I'm bleeding in ways of the tire burned
I'm crying in ways of the nightbird
No more is there one to lay by my s de
I'm straying in nightmares all the timeA little something I know
A little somewhere I go rem nds me of youTo blossom blue is to blossom without youI'm breaking but I cannot bear to
I'm staring but I cannot see you
For no more are you to lay by my side
I'm weeping no more then this second timeA little something I know
A little somewhere I go
Where the sweet waters flow reminds me of youA little something I know
A little somewhere I go
Where the sweet waters flow
Where the mistletoes grow reminds me of youTo blossom blue is to blossom without you
