Consider Yourself
Consider yourself at home
Consider youself one of the family
We've taken to you so strong
It's clear we're going to get along
Consider yourself well in
Consider yourself part of the furniture
There isn't a lot to spare
Who cares?.What ever we've got, we share!If it should chance to be
We should see
Some harder days
Empty larder days
Why grouse?
Always-a-chance we'll meet
Somebody
To foot the bill
Then the drinks are on the house!
Consider yourself our mate
We don't want to have no fuss,
For after some consideration, we can state
Consider yourself
