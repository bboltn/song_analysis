Dancing In the Minefields
Well, I was nineteen, you were twenty-one
The year we got engaged
And everyone said we were much too young
But we did it anywayWe got the rings for forty each
From a pawn shop down the road
We said our vows and took the leap
Now fifteen years agoAnd we went dancing in the minefields
We went sailing in the storms
And it was harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for"I do" are the two most famous last words
The beginning of the end
But to lose your life for another, I've heard
Is a good place to begin'Cause the only way to find your life
Is to lay your own life down
And I believe it's an easy price
For the life that we have foundAnd we're dancing in the minefields
We're sailing in the storms
This is harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
That's what the promise is forSo when I loose my way, find me
When I loose love's chains, bind me
At the end of all my faith, till the end of all my days
When I forget my name, remind me'Cause we bear the light of the Son of Man
So there's nothing left to fear
So I'll walk with you in the shadowlands
Till the shadows disappear'Cause he promised not to leave us
And his promises are true
So in the face of all this chaos
Baby, I can dance with youSo let's go dancing in the minefields
Let's go sailing in the storms
Oh, let's go dancing in the minefields
And kicking down the doorsOh, let's go dancing in the minefields
And sailing in the storms
Oh, this is harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
That's what the promise is for
