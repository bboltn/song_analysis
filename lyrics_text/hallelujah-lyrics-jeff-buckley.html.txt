Hallelujah
I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing HallelujahHallelujah
Hallelujah
HallelujahHallelujahWell your faith was strong but you needed proofYou saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chairShe broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
HallelujahHallelujah
Hallelujah
HallelujahBaby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floorYou know, I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And Love is not a victory marchIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
HallelujahWell, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
HallelujahMaybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?
And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
