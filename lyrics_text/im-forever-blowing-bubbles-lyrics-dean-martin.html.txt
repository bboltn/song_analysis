I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high, nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and dieFortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the airI'm f-f-forever b-b-blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They f-f-fly so high, nearly reach the sky
Then in my d-d-dreams they fade and d-d-dieFortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm f-f-forever b-b-blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the airI'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles, no more troubles
Pretty bubbles in the air
