Looking For Love
I spent a lifetime lookin' for you
Single bars and good time lovers were never true
Playing a fools game, hopin' to win
And tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again.Chorus
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover,
Another heart- lookin' for love.And I was alone then, no love in sight
I did every thing I could to get me through the night
I don't know where it started or where it might end
I'd turn to a stranger just like a friend.Chorus
'Cause I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover,
Another heart- lookin' for love.
And you came a knockin' at my hearts door
You're everything I've been lookin' for
There's no more lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I found a friend and a lover
God blessed the day I discovered you-oh you
Looking for love(Lookin' for love) In all the wrong places
(Lookin' for love) In too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I found a friend and a lover
God blessed the day I discovered you-oh you
Looking for love
(Lookin' for love) In all the wrong places
(Lookin' for love) In too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I found a friend and a lover
God blessed the day I discovered you-oh you
Looking for love
