Johnny Cash Heart
[Verse 1]
It can be a cold winter sunday
The kind where you can't get out of bed
You were my El Paso south wind
The sin that paints my desert red
You're an amen on a Carolina sand dune
A prayer that washes up on my shore
The blue sky that cuts through the black night
When i can't feel anymore[Chorus]
You wrap me up in some kind of magic
Lift me up, take me so high
Finally something good for me happened
Such a rush, can't get enough of your love
Show me every color I can imagine
When its november and my soul is dark
You are my june
June in my johnny cash heart[Verse 2]
Everybody's got an addiction
A real good feel good they need
Some trains, they don't hear you coming
'Til they are baring down on you
And your demons got you on your knees[Chorus]
You wrap me up in some kind of magic
Lift me up, take me so high
Finally something good for me happened
Such a rush, can't get enough of your love
Show me every color I can imagine
When its november and my soul is dark
You are my june
June in my Johnny Cash heart[Bridge]
We can take that cold winter Sunday
Set fire to that Carolina sand dune
Girl, you love the hurt and the hell outta me, yeah[Chorus]
When you wrap me up in some kind of magic
Lift me up, take me so high
Finally something good for me happened
Such a rush, can't get enough of your love
Show me every color I can imagine
When its november and my soul is dark
You are my june
June in my Johnny Cash heart[Outro]
You are my June
You are my June
