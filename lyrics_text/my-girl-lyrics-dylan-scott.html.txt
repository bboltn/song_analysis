My Girl
She looks so pretty with no makeup on
You should hear her talkin' to her momma on the phone
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song
That's my girlMan her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girlYeah, that's my girl
In the passenger seat,
windows down dancin' around causin' a scene
That's my girl sippin' crown and sprite,in a ball cap turned back ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin all the guys wishin' you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girlEvery night before she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thank the lord for another day
I just thank him for my girlYeah, that's my girl
In the passenger seat windows down
dancin' around causin' a scene
That's my girl, sippin' crown and sprite,In a ball cap turned back ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
