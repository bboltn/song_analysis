Earned It
You make it look like it's magic
Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confusedHey, hey
I'm so used to being used
So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moment's expectedSo I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work itCause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind
We live with no liesHey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night
So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moment's expectedSo I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work itCause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
On that lonely night
You said it wouldn't be loveBut we felt the rush
It made us believe it there was only us
Convinced we were broken inside, inside
Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
