It's Been A Long Time Coming
I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been running ever sinceIt's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it willIt's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
I don't know what's up there beyond the skyI go to the movie and I go downtown but
somebody keep telling me don't hang aroundIt's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh yes it willThen I go to my brother
I say brother help me please
But he winds up knocking me
Back down on my kneesThere's been times that I thought
I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh, yes it will
