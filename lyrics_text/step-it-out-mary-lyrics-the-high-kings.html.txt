Step It Out Mary
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Step it out, mary, if you can
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Show your legs to the countryman (x2)In the village of Kilgory, there's a maiden young and fair
Her eyes shine like diamonds, she has long and golden hair
The horseman he comes riding, riding up to her father's gates
On a milk-white stallion, he comes at the strike of eight.Chorus:
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Step it out, mary, if you can
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Show your legs to the countryman (x2)
I have come to court your daughter, Mary of the golden hair
I have gold and I have silver, I have goods beyond compare
I will buy her silks and satin and a gold ring for her hand
She shall have a mansion, she'll have servants to commandStep it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Step it out, mary, if you can
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Show your legs to the countryman (x2)
I don't want your gold and silver, I don't want your house and land
I am going with a soldier, I have promised him my hand
But the father spoke up sharply: You will do as i command,
You'll get married on a Sunday and you'll wear that wedding bandStep it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Step it out, mary, if you can
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Show your legs to the countryman (x2)
In the village of Kilgory there's a deep stream flowing by
On her wedding day at midnight she drowns with her soldier boy
In the cottage there is music, you can hear her father say:
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter, Sunday is your wedding day.Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Step it out, mary, if you can
Step it out, Mary, my fine daughter
Show your legs to the countryman (x4)
