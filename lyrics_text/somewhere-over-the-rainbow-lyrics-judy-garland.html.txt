Somewhere Over the Rainbow
Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
there's a land that i have heard of once in a lullaby
somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come trueSomeday i'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
where troubles melt like lemon drops
way above the chimney tops that's where you'll find meSomewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
birds fly over the rainbow why then oh why can't i?Someday i'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
where troubles melt like lemon drops
way above the chimney tops that's where (where) you'll (you'll) find meSomewhere over the rainbow the bluebirds fly
birds fly over the rainbow why then oh why can't i?
(why oh why yeah yeah)If bluebirds fly (if bluebirds fly) over the rainbow why, oh why can't i?
