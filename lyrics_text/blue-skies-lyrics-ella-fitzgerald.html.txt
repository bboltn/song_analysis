Blue Skies
Version 1"Blue skies smilin' at me
Nothin' but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long
Never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they flyBlue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smilin' at me
Nothin' but blue skies do I seeNever saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they flyBlue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on"
-----Version 2I was blue, just as blue as I could be
Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door
Skies were gray but they're not gray anymoreBlue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies
Do I seeBluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds
All day longNever saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they flyBlue days
All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now onI should care if the wind blows east or west
I should fret if the worst looks like the best
I should mind if they say it can't be true
I should smile, that's exactly what I do
