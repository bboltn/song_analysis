Heavy
If you're lost and you're lonely
Go and figure out why
Take a trip to your dark side
Go on and have a good cry
'Cause we're all lonely
Yeah, we're all lonely togetherI want to see your sadness
I want to share your sin
I want to bleed your blood and
I want to be let in
Don't you just
Don't we all just
Want to be togetherLeave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behindIf your face is down
Take a look around
Do your fingers move?
Do your lungs inflate?
Are you tired, are you weary
Of the hidden hate you've been holding?
Hey, did you lose that love or have you never had it?
Are you feeling sad 'cause you did a bad thing?
HeyLeave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behindAre you feeling fearful, brother?
Are you feeling fearful, sister?
The only way to lose that fearful feeling
Replace it with love that's healing
Are you feeling fearful, brother?
Are you feeling fearful, sister?Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
