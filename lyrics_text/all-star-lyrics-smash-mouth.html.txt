All Star
Somebody once told me
The world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In shape of an "L" on her foreheadWell the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense
Not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do
So much to seeSo what's wrong with taking the back street
You'll never know if you don't goYou'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now
You're an all star
Get your game on
Go playHey now
You're a rock Star
Get the show on
Get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place
And they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now
Wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men
Beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite pictureThe ice we skateIs getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm
So you might as well swim
My world's on fireHow about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get boredHey nowYou're an all star
Get your game on
Go play
Hey now
You're a rock star
Get the show onGet paidAnd all that glitters is goldOnly shooting stars break the mold
Hey now
You're an all star
Get your game on
Go playHey now
You're a rock starGet the show on
Get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars
Somebody once asked
Could you spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yepWhat a concept
I could use
A little fuel myselfAnd we could all use a little change
Well the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
