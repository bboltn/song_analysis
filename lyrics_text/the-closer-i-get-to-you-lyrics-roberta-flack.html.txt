The Closer I Get To You
The closer I get to you
The more you'll make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured meOver and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feelLying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a trySweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With the hearts in love they find
True love
In a special wayThe closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured meOver and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feelThe closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving you all I've got
Your love has captured meThe closer I get to you
A feeling comes over me
(Me too)
Falling closer
Sweet as the gravity
