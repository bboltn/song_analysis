To Leave Something Behind
I can not say I know him well
But you can not lie to me with all these books it sells
I'm not trying to go to the end of the world
I'm just trying to leave something behindThe words have come from men and mouse
But I can not help thinking that I have heard the wrong people
When all the water is gone my work will be too
And I'm trying to leave something behindOh, money is free but love costs more than our daily bread
And the roof is hard to access
Oh, the future ahead is broken and red
But I'm trying to leave something behindThis whole world is a foreign land
We swallow the moon, but we do not know our own hand
We're running with the case, but is not gold
However, we are trying to leave something behindMy friends who I think are in the wrong fight
And I can not read what I have not written
I've been at home, but the teacher is gone
But I would like to leave somethingThere is a beast that has taken my brain
Can you put to bed, but you can not feel my pain
When the machine has taken the soul of man
It's time to leave something behindOh, money is free but love costs more than our daily bread
And the roof is hard to access
Oh, the future ahead is dead
So I'm trying to leave something behindI feel I'm still on the shore
And the pockets do not know what it means to be poor
I can get through the wall if you give me a door
So I can leave something behindOh wisdom is lost somewhere in the trees
You will not find in a little mental gray hair
It is closed from the hurrying ahead
And it's time to leave something behind
Oh, money is free but love costs more than our daily bread
And the roof is hard to access
When my son is a man who knows what I mean
I was just trying to leave something behind
I was just trying to leave something behind
