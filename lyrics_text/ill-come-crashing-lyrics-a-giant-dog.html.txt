I'll Come Crashing
Nothing in my nature tells me not to do bad things
I know that I really should be good tonight
There's a kind of satisfaction that destruction brings
Consequences never could convince me that I should do rightI'll come crashin'
I'll come crashin'
I'll come crashin'
Down in my ash of a fire that I builtMama always told me I should have a sense of pride
Daddy always told me how to be a straight up guy
Always tell the truth and never have a thing to hide
But I'm gonna shoot the moon and watch it fall from the skyI'll come crashin'
I'll come crashin'
I'll come crashin'
Down in my ash of a fire that I builtNothing matches the passion and thrill of desire over guiltI'll come crashin'
I'll come crashin'
I'll come crashin'
Down in my ash of a fire that I builtNothing matches the passion and thrill of desire over guilt
