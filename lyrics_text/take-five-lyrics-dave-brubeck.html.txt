Take Five
Won't you stop and take
A little time out with me
Just take five
Stop your busy day
And take the time out
To see if I'm aliveThough I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a playStill, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my wayWouldn't it be better
Not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now
It's alright, just take five
Just take fiveThough I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a playStill, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my wayWouldn't it be better
Not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now
It's alright, just take five
Just take five
