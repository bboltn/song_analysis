Never Be the Same
Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
Let go of the ways I used to fall in lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate meJust like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, all I needIt's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never ever, ever be the sameI'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the sameSneaking in LA when the lights are low
Off of one touch I could overdose
He said: Stop playing it safe, girl, I wanna see you lose controlJust like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, ooh, yeah, you're all I needIt's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never ever, ever be the sameI'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the sameYou're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my headIt's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never ever, ever be the sameJust one hit, you will know I'll never ever, ever be the same
