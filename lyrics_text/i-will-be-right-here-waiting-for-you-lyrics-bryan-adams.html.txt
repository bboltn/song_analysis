Right Here Waiting For You
Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the painIf I see you next to never
How can we say forever?Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes, or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for youI took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter and taste the tears
But I can't get near you nowOh, can't you see it baby?
You've got me goin' crazyWherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for youI wonder how we can survive this romance
But in the end if I'm with you I'll take the chanceOh, can't you see it baby?
You've got me goin' crazyWherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you,
waiting for you
