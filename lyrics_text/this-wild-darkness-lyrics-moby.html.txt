This Wild Darkness
A potion like madness and season
Bracing all like a breaking of reason
But every night lost and every day torn
The drama feeling calmer, it's a calmer in the storm
Speakers are crying like a forest in the rain
I was so alone with my thoughts and my pain
And the darkness closed like a mouth on a [?]
I'll never be freeOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayI can't stand on my own anymore
I can't stand in the stain of the broken and poor
I can't break what I held and it never was true
In the mirror what I said was I lied to you
And me and everything I see and everything I could
Tried so hard to be good
For myself, for you, for the hidden and divine
For everything but I can fail just so many timesOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayI can't stop when I feel like stopping
At 5 A.M. just cry [?]
A perfect life was enough for you
And ever enough to see me through
For all my lies that were spoken and ways
And the way we lived as an affront to the days
Was an affront to the things that we cared about
Was an affront to everything that we cared aboutOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my wayOoh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way
