Budapest
My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful CastilloYou
You
I''d leave it all
My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe
But for you
You
I''d leave it all
Oh, for you
You
I''d leave it allGive me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go awayMy many artifacts
The list goes on
If you just say the words, I
I''ll up and run
Oh, to you
You
I''d leave it allOh, to you
You
I''d leave it allGive me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go awayGive me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My friends and family
They, don't understand
They fear they''d lose so much
If you took my hand
But for you
You
I''d lose it all
But for you
You
I''d lose it allGive me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go awayGive me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
