Missing
I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door, but you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space
You've found some better placeAnd I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rainCould you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead, of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout down to me
Where I always used to beAnd I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rainBack on the train, I ask why did I come again?
Can I confess, I've been hanging round your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer, nothing since you've moved
You're long gone, but I can't move onAnd I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss youI step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door, I guess you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space
You've found some better placeAnd I miss you,
And I miss you,
You found some better placeAnd I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, and I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain
The deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain,
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain
