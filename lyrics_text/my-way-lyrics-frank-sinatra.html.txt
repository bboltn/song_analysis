My Way
And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certainI've lived a life that's full
I've travelled each and every highway
and more, much more than this
I did it my wayRegrets I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemptionI planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the by-way
And more, much more than this
I did it my wayYes, there were times
I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it allAnd I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed, and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losingAnd now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way"Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way"
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way
