Seasons Of Love
Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes.
Five hundred twenty five thousand moments so dear.
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes.
How do you measure,
Measure a year?In daylights?
In sunsets?
In midnights?
In cups of coffee?
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife?In five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes.
How do you measure a year in a life?How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love...
Seasons of love...
Seasons of love...Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes.
Five hundred twenty five thousand journeys to plan.
Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes.
How do you measure a life of a woman or a man?In truths that she learned,
or in times that he cried?
In bridges he burned,
or the way that she died?It's time now to sing out,
though the story never ends.
Let's celebrate remember a year in a life
