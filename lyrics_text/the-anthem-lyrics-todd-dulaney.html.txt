The Anthem
Hallelujah
You have won the victory
Hallelujah
You have won it all for meDeath could not hold you down
You are the risen king
Seated in majesty
You are the risen kingBy his stripes we are healed
By his nail pierced hands we're free
By his blood, we're washed clean
Now we have the victory.The power of sin is broken
Jesus overcame it all
He has won our freedom
Jesus has won it all
Our God is risen
He is alive
He's won the victory
He reigns on high
