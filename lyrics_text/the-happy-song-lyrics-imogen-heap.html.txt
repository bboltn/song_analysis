The Happy Song
Bring! Bring! On the bicycle
Beep! Beep! In the car
Ping! Ping! A submarinePhew! Phew! helicopter
A choo-choo train
An aeroplane
A "wee!" down the slideI just adore-dore-dore
You every day more
Wherever we areSo up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we goBring! Bring! On the bicycle
Beep! Beep! In the car
Ping! Ping! A submarine
Phew! Phew! helicopter
A choo-choo train
An aeroplane
A rocket to the stars!There's a dance-dance-dance
Going on in my heart
Wherever we areSo up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we goYou little monkey
You're staying up late
Who purrs like a cat
When they get their own
Who then turns into a lion
Who lets out a...(RAWR!)I love-love-love
You every day more
Whatever's in storeSo up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we goSo up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we go
