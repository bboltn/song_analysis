Everybody Gets A Kitten
Gotta say the future's awesome,
Everything is a-okay,
All the work is done by robots,
Everyday is Saturday,
Future people all have jet-packs,
Fly around in flying cars,
There's so much I could tell you,
but the coolest part by far,Everybody gets a kitten,
A new one every single day,
Everybody gets a kitten,
You can name if you want,
Or you can give it away.There is no disease or hunger,
Zero poverty or war,
Life is just a giant party,
And no one here is ever bored,
All the factories burn rainbows
You can buy a house on Mars,
There's so much I could tell you,
But the coolest part by farEverybody gets a kitten,
a new one every single day,
Everybody gets a kitten,
you can name if you want,
or not,Everybody gets a kitten
A new one every single day,
Everybody gets a kitten,
You can name if you want,
or you can give it away
