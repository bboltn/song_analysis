Never Give Up
I've battled demons that won't let me sleep
Called to the sea but she abandoned meBut I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no
No, I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, noAnd I won't let you get me down
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
I won't let you get me down
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, ohI'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, ohOh yeah, I'm haunted by the distant past
Called to the skies but she was she overcastBut I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no
No, I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, noAnd I won't let you get me down
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
I won't let you get me down
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, ohI'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, ohNever give up, never give up
Never give up, never give up
No, no, ooohAnd I won't let you get me down
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
I won't let you get me down
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, ohI'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
