Place Of Freedom
There's a calm that covers me
When I kneel down at Your feet
It's a place of healing
It's a place where I find freedomThere's a place my eyes can't see
Where my spirit longs to be
It's a place of healing
It's a place I live in freedomI'm gonna lift my hands
Til I can reach heaven
I'm gonna shout Your name
Til the walls come falling down
I've come to worship
I've come to worshipThere's a love that lives in me
For You Lord, my savior King
Breaks the sin that's binding
And leads me to a place of freedomI'm gonna lift my hands
Til I can reach heaven
I'm gonna shout Your name
Til the walls come falling down
I've come to worship
I've come to worshipI'm gonna sing my song
Like I am unashamed
I'm gonna shout for joy
At the mention of your name
I've come to worship
I've come to worshipThere is no one
that can bring me peace
That can wash me clean
like you Lord
There is nothing
in this world that can free me
You saved my soulI'm gonna lift my hands
Til I can reach heaven
I'm gonna shout Your name
