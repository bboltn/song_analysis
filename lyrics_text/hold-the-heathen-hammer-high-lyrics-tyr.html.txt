Hold The Heathen Hammer High
Heathen heart
Pagan pride
Faring far
Sword by SideTribal times
Northern nights
Hidden high
Runic rites I was toldHold the heathen hammer high
Hold the heathen hammer high
Hold the heathen hammer highHold the heathen hammer high with a battle cry
For the pagan past I live and one day will die
Hold the heathen hammer high, never turn away
Ever true unto your forefathers stalwart stayHold the Heathen Hammer high with a battle cry
For the pagan past I live and one day will die
Hold the heathen hammer high, never turn away
Down the wayward way so far faring strangers strayHold the heathen hammer highWeather wild
Blackened blade
Angry eyes
Ruthless raidHeathen heart
Pagan pride
Faring far
Sword by side
Hard and coldHold the heathen hammer high

Down the wayward way so far faring strangers strayHold the heathen hammer highFrom a pagan past that only the heathen hold
From the far end of the world and of times untold
I bring message to your mids of the ways of old
Ways reluctantly abandoned if truth be toldWays abandoned for a scavenger of our souls
Living on malicious lies, hiding in the holes
Cruel and credible as any our tale of trolls
Hold the heathen hammer highest of all your goals
Hold the heathen hammer high with a battle cry
For the pagan past I live and one day will die
Hold the heathen hammer high, never turn away
Ever true unto your forefathers stalwart stay
Hold the Heathen Hammer high with a battle cry
For the pagan past I live and one day will die
Hold the heathen hammer high, never turn away
Down the wayward way so far faring strangers stray
Hold the heathen hammer high
Hold the heathen hammer high
Hold the heathen hammer high
Hold the heathen hammer high
Hold the heathen hammer high
