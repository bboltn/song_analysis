The Tracks Of My Tears
People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blueSo take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tearsI need you, need youSince you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute, she's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent oneSo take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah, look a little bit closer and it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tearsI need you, need youOutside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown ooh yeah since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up with youBaby take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah just look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears baby, baby baby babyTake a good look at my face
Yeah you'll see my smile looks out of place
Look little bit closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
