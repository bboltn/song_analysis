In A Manner Of Speaking
In a Manner of speaking
I just want to say
That I could never forget the way
You told me everything
By saying nothingIn a manner of speaking
I don't understand
How love in silence becomes reprimand
But the way that i feel about you
Is beyond wordsOh give me the words
Give me the words
but tell me nothing
Ohohohoh give me the words
Give me the words
That tell me everythingIn a manner of speaking
Semantics won't do
In this life that we live we only make do
And the way that we feel
Might have to be sacrifiedSo in a manner of speaking
I just want to say
That just like you I should find a way
To tell you everything
By saying nothing.Oh give me the words
Give me the words
but tell me nothing
Ohohohoh give me the words
Give me the words
That tell me everythingOh give me the words
Give me the words
but tell me nothing
Ohohohoh give me the words
Give me the words
That tell me everything
