Skinny Love
Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My my my, my my my, my-my-my my-my...
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer.Tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My my my, my my my, my-my-my my-my...
Right in the moment this order's tall.And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kindAnd in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines.Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My my my, my my my, my-my-my my-my...
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split.And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kindNow all your love is wasted
Who the hell was I?
Now I'm breaking at the britches
At the end of all your lines.Who will love you?
Who will fight?
And who will fall far behind?
Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My my my, my my my, my-my-my my-my...
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split
