When Your Mind's Made Up
So, if you want something
And you call, call
Then I'll come running
To fight and I'll be at your door
When there's nothing worth running forWhen your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change itWhen your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to stop it, you seeYou're just like everyone
When the shit falls
All you wanna do is run away
And hide all by yourself
When there's far from, there's nothing elseWhen your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change itWhen your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point even talkingWhen your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to fight itWhen your mind's, your mind
Love, love
There's no point trying to change it
When your loveSo if you ever want something
And you call, call
Then I'll come running
