Sing Me to Sleep
Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choiceAnywhere, anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breathSing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Oh, just sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleepRemember me now, time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullabySing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Oh, just sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleepA-anytime
I would do
Time away
Yesterday-day-day-dayA-anytime
I would do
Time away
Yesterday-day-day-day
