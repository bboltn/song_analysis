A Love So Beautiful
The summer sun looked down
On our love long ago
But in my heart I feel
The same old afterglowA love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip awayWe were too young to understand
To ever know
That lovers drift apart
And that's the way love goesA love so beautiful
A love so sweet
A love so beautiful
A love for you and meAnd I when I think of you
I fall in love againA love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip awayA love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip away
