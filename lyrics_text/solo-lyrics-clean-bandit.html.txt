Solo
[Intro]
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
Woop woop woop woop woop woop woop[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
I never meant to leave you hurting
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (It solo, solo, everybody)
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (It solo, solo, everybody)[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Since you've been gone
Been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I wanna f-woop woop woop but I'm broken hearted
Cry-cry-cry but I like to party
T-t-touch but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop woop woop but I'm broken hearted
Cry-cry-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo[Post-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Every single night I lose it
I can't even hear the music without you (It solo, solo, everybody)
Ah, yeah, yeah
Try to stop myself from calling but I really wanna know if you're with someone new (It solo, solo, everybody)[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I wanna f-woop woop woop but I'm broken hearted
Cry-cry-cry but I like to party
T-t-touch but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop woop woop but I'm broken hearted
Cry-cry-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo[Post-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo[Bridge: Demi Lovato]
Can't do it solo[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I wanna f-woop woop woop but I'm broken hearted
Cry-cry-cry but I like to party
T-t-touch but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop woop woop but I'm broken hearted
Cry-cry-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo[Post-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo[Outro]
So I do it solo
