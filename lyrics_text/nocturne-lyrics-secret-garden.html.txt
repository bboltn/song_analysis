Nocturne
Now let the day
Just slip away
So the dark night may watch over you
Velvet blue, silent true
It embraces your heart and your soul
NocturneNever cry, never sigh
You don't have to wonder why
Always be, always see
Come and dream the night with me
NocturneHave no fear
When the night draws near
And fills you with dreams and desire
Like a child asleep
So warm, so deep
You will find me there waiting for you
NocturneWe will fly, claim the sky
We don't have to wonder why
Always be, always see
Come and dream the night with me
NocturneThough darkness lay
It will give way
When the dark night delivers the day
Nocturne
