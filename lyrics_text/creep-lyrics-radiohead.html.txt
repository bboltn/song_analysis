Creep
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful worldI wish I was special
You're so fuckin' specialBut I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong hereI don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not aroundSo fuckin' special
I wish I was specialBut I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong hereShe's running out the door
She's running out
She's run, run, run, runWhatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
