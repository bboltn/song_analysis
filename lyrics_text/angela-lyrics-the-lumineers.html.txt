Angela
When you left this town, with your windows down
And the wilderness insideLet the exits pass, all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky alignThe strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time comingAnd your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signsBut you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mindFrom the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time comingHome at lastWere you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fistDid you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?Strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming in
Oh Angela spent your whole life running away
Home at last
Home at last
Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knees, I belong, I believe
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
