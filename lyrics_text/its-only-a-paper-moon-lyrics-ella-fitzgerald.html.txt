It's Only a Paper Moon
Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in meYes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in meWithout your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcadeIt's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in meSay, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in meYes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in meWithout your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcadeIt's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in meIt's phony it's plain to see
How happy I would be
If you believed in me.
