Shotgun
Home grown alligator
See you later
Gotta hit the road
Gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architects are unfamiliar
I can get used to thisTime flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain top that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know were I'll beI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someoneThe south of be acquainted, navigate it
Gotta hit the road
Gotta hit the road
A dipsy dive around the clock
Bikini bottom, larger tops
I could get used to thisTime flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain top that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know were I'll beI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someoneWe got too little fun
Too little that
Singing along
Along with thatTime flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know were I'll beI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
