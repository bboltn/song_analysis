Food, Glorious Food
Is it worth the waiting for?
If we live for eighty four
All we ever get is gruel!
Every day we say our prayer --
Will they change the bill of fare?
Still we get the same old gruel!
There's not a crust, not a crumb can we find,
Can we beg, can we borrow, or cadge,
But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill
When we all close our eyes and imagine
Food, glorious food!
Hot sausage and mustard!
While we're in the mood --
Cold jelly and custard! (soloist 1)
Peas pudding and saveloys
What next is the question? (soloist 2)
Rich gentlemen have it, boys --
in digestion!Food Glorious food
We're anxious to try it
Three banquets a day
Our favorite diet
Just picture a great big steak
Fried, roasted, or stewed
Oh food! magical food! wonderful
food! marvelous food!What wouldn't we give for
That extra bit more
That's all we live for
Why should we be fated to do
Nothing but brood on food
Magical food,
Wonderful food
marvelous food,
Beautiful food,
Food, Glorious food glorious fooooooood
