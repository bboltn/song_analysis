On The Floor
It's something about cha girl,

you got me wanting to tell all them other girls,
theres nothing else better on this world!
the moment i seen her i was in shock
so shocked you would've think that i've just been shot,
shot down right down in this spot.
But too bad this doesn't happen alot.
Oh girl you got me visualizing me on top,
on top of yo hot body while were sweating alot,
alot of time on the clock before we would have to stop.
too bad shes not into that stuff alot,
oh man shes just super hot,
hotter than the sun that's right on top,
on top of our heads oh man there she goes so i had to stop,
and ask her some questions that i had in stock.She said she want's to take it slow,
im not that type of guy ill let cha know,
when i see that red light all i know is go,

a pro at being the one that i want to know,

Oh girl you drove me out my mind,
