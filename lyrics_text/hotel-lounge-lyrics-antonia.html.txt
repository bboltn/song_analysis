Hotel Lounge
All I see is you I need to know how
How you get that pretty fame with that waist now
Every curve on your body is a play ground
Call me baby wine that'll meet you- meet yaGirl where's your cup here's one more round on me
Got two bodies on the floor all I see is you and meNow let's go
Come meet me in the hotel lounge, I'm feeling lonely
You know it's too late to turn back now
D-Do you want me? Baby all to yourself
Show me baby come spend the night over
Come meet me in the hotel loungeWanna see what you feel with the lights out
You a tease, it ain't easy to slow down
And your body talking to me I'm an expert
Call me baby, I'll try that I'll meet you- meet yaGirl where's your cup, here's one more round on me
Got two bodies on the floor, all I see is you and meNow let's go,
Come meet in the hotel lounge
I'm feeling lonely, you know it's to late to turn back now
D-Do you want me all to yourself
Show me baby, come spend the night over
Come meet me in the hotel loungeThey say the freaks come out at night
So baby come on out and play versuri.us
I come alive when the lights go off
Then I run that game, I keep on telling you
Something your making me feel
I cannot help it, I'm falling your making it real?
