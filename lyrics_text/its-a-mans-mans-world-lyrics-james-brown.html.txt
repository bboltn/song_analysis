It`s A Man's Man's World
This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girlYou see man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy loadMan made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the arkThis is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girlMan thinks about a little bit of baby girls
And a baby boys
Man makes them happy
'Cause man makes them toysAnd after man's made everything
Everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other manThis is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Not one little thing
Without a woman or a girlHe's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness
He's lost
