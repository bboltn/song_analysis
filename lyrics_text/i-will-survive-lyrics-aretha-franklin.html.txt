I Will Survive
At first I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you did me wrongAnd I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you hereWith that sad look upon you're face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made leave your key
If I'd known for just one secondYou'd be back to bother me.
Go on now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around nowCause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbyes
Do you think I'd crumble?Do you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no not I
I will surviveOh as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to giveAnd I will survive
I will survive
Hey Hey!
It took all the strength I hadNot to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nightsJust feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high.
And you'll see meSomebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with youAnd so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my lovin'For someone who's lovin' me
Go on now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you I crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no not I
I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive
I will survive
oh now go walk out the door
just turn around now
cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbyes
Did you think I'd crumble did you think I lay down and die oh no not I I will survive Oh s long as I know how to love I know I will be in live
