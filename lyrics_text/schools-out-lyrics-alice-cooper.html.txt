School's Out
Well, we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin' all that noise
'Cause they found new toysWell, we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya
That's a dragSchool's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to piecesNo more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's
Dirty looksWell, we got no class
And we got no principals
We ain't got no intelligence
We can't even think of a word that rhymesSchool's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to piecesNo more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's
Dirty looksOut for summer
Out till fall
We might not come
Back at allSchool's out forever
School's out for summer
school's out with fever
School's out completely
