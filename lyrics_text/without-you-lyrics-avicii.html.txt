Without you
You said that we would always be
Without you, I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness, you'd hide with me
Like the wind, we'd be wild and freeYou said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be thereI've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle, and I'm just about to
Figure it out without youAnd I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm going Bonnie and Clyde without youNow I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating, I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were hereYou said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be thereI've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle, and I'm just about to
Figure it out without youAnd I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm going Bonnie and Clyde without you
