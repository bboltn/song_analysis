Faith's Song
Gave you all that you needed
You cut but I'm bleeding
And all of my strength that I gave to you
I loved completely
You lose then you leave me
And all of my hope
I left with you tooBut I gave my heart whole I did
I gave my heart
And although it's lost
It is still beating
And I gave my whole soul I did
I gave my soul
And although I'm broken
I am still breathingI will sleep through the moments
All the moments you've stolen
All for my love
I'll learn the truthThat I gave my heart whole I did
I gave my heart
And although it's lost
It is still beating
And I gave my whole soul I did
I gave my soul
And although I'm broken
I am still breathing
