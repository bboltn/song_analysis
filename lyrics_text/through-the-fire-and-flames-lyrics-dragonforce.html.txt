Through The Fire And Flames
On a warm summers morning, in a time after the dark
In sea of life eternal reign we ride towards the peace
When the lightness has fallen down and the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonightFighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell, bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain we watch them as we go
In fire and pain and once again we knowSo now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our soulsSo far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry onAs the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment to their eyes
Running back from the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the starsIn your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny is time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonightAnd on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go onSo far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry onWhoa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oaWhoa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oaNow here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now can we understand
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every manSo far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on
