Smile
Smile tho' your heart is aching
Smile even tho' it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get byIf you smile
Thro' your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shin-ing thro' for youLight up your face with gladness
Hide ev-'ry trace of sadness
Altho' a tear may be ever so nearThat's the time
You must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worth-whileIf you just smile
