Tell Me About It
They say that there's a hole in the atmosphere
The things you think will last just disappear
When you were ready to say I do
Somebody lowered the boom on you
Now you need a sympathetic earSo Baby. . .Chorus:Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me all about your broken heartYou say you need someone to hold you tight
Ya can't stand another lonely night
Well come closer and
Tell me about itLove isn't always true it hurts sometimes
Your tears will tell on you girl, I'm not blind
I know what you're goin' through
I graduated from that school too
If you need a shoulder cry on mineTell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me all about your broken heartYou say you need someone to hold you tight
Ya can't stand another lonely night
Well come closer and
Tell me about itYou took a lesson in playin' a fool
I graduated from that school too
If you need a shoulder cry on mineTell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me all about your broken heartYou say you need someone to hold you tight
Ya can't stand another lonely night
Well come closer and
Tell me about itRepeat to fade
