Walk My Way
What a fool?
Thought I'd wrapped up the case
I went and promised my heart
But you just laughed in my faceWhat a fall?
Never thought I'd forget you
I gave it all
But I've got no regretI loved you
I cared
She's so deadSo if by chance you walk my way
And feel the joy and pain of yesterday
You'll never need a reason to pretendA simple smile is all I ask
The smile you hide behind your painted mask
Somewhere between a stranger and a friendWhat a crime, baby?
When you want someone so
I put my heart on the line
But I had to let go, ooo oooIt's overSo if by chance you walk my way
And feel the joy and pain of yesterday
You'll never need a reason to pretendA simple smile is all I ask
The smile you hide behind your painted mask
Somewhere between a stranger and a friendNow, my love
(It's over) (Ooo, hoo, hoo)
So if by chance you walk my way
(You walk my way)
And feel the joy and pain of yesterday
You'll never need a reason to pretendNo, no, no, no
A simple smile is all I ask
(Is all I ask)
The smile you hide behind your painted mask
Somewhere between a stranger and a friendYou'll never know you've hurt me, baby
(Walk my way)
You'll never know you've hurt me, baby
(Walk my way)
You'll never know you've hurt me, baby
(Walk my way)
You'll never know you've hurt me, baby
(Walk my way)
You'll never know you've hurt me, baby
(Walk my way)
You'll never know you've hurt me, baby
