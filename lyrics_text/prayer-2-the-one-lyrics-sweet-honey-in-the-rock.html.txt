Prayer 2 The One
He is my everything, He is my all
He is my everything, Both great & small.He gave his life for me, made everything new,
he is my everything, Now how about you?like Honey in the Rock, Sweet Honey in the Rock...for he tastes like Honey in the Rock...O, taste & see, that the lord is Good...
for he tastes like Honey in the Rock.He is my everything, He is my all
He is my everything, Both great & small.
