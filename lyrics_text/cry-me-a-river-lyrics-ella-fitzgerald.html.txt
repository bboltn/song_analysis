Cry Me A River
Now you say you're lonely
you cry the long night through
well, you can cry me a river
cry me a river
i cried a river over you
now you say you're sorry
for being so untrue
well, you can cry me a river
cry me a river
i cried a river over youyou drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
while you never shed a tear
remember, i remember, all that you said?
you told me love was too plebeian
told me you were through with me and
Now you say you love me
well, just to prove that you do
come on and cry me a river
cry me a river
i cried a river over you
i cried a river over you
i cried a river... over you...You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
while you never shed a tear
remember, i remember, all that you said?
you told me love was too plebeian
told me you were through with me and
Now you say you love me
well, just to prove that you do
come on and cry, cry, cry me a river
cry me a river
i cried, i cried, i cried a river over youif my pillow talk, imagine what it would have said
could it be a river of tears i cried instead?
well you can cry me a river
go ahead and cry me a river
'cause i cried, i cried a river over you
how i cried a river over you
