All the World (I Tell Myself)
Say that I'm changed, say I'm different
Maybe I'll finally understand
Say I'll let go, say it's obvious
Oh, I tell myself over, over and over againI'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready to believeSo tell me I'm strong, tell me I'm weak
Tell me I'll never, ever bend
Then tell me I'm fire, tell me I'm cold
Cold oh, I tell myself over, over and over againI'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready to believeAnd all the world can watch the choices you make
All the world can watch each tiny mistake
Let the world watch to let the world wait for you
So tell me I'm wrong, or tell me I'm cruel
Tell me I'd fight, yeah tell me I fought for the wrong thingsBut I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready to believe
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready to believe
