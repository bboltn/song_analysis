I'd Rather Go Blind
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talkin'
Something deep down in my soul said, 'Cry, girl'
When I saw you and that girl walkin' aroundWhoo, I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me, child, noWhoo, so you see, I love you so much
That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't wanna be free, noWhoo, whoo, I was just, I was just, I was just
Sittin here thinkin', of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now, baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeahWhoo and baby, baby, I'd rather, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
Whoo, baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind...
