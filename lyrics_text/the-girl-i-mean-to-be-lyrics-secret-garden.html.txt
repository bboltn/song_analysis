The Girl I Mean To Be
I need a place where I can go
Where I can whisper what I know
Where I can whisper who I like
And where I go to see themI need a place where I can hide
Where no one sees my life inside
Where I can take my plans and write them down
So I can read themA place where I can bid my heart be still
And it will mind me
A place where I can go when I am lost
And there I will find meI need a place to spend the day
Where no one says to go or stay
Where I can take my pen and draw
The girl I mean to be
