Why Don't You Do Right
Why Don't You Do Right
Performed by Peggy LeeYou had plenty of money 1922
You let other women make a fool of you*Why don't you do right
Like some other men do
Get out of here and get me some money, tooYou're sittin' down wonderin' what it's all about
You ain't got no money that will put you out(Repeat *)If you had prepared 20 years ago
You wouldn't be a-wanderin' now from door to door(Repeat *)I fell for you jiving and I took you in
Now all you've got to offer me is a drink of gin(Repeat *)
