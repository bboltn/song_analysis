Blue Sky Collapse
As I walk to the end of the line
I wonder if I should look back
To all of the things that were said and done
I think we should talk it overThen I noticed the sign on your back
It boldly says try to look away
I go on pretending I'll be ok
This morning it hits me hard thatStill everyday I think about you
I know for a fact that's not your problem
But if you change your mind you'll find me
Hanging on to the place
Where the big blue sky collapseAs I stare at the wall in this room
The cracks they resemble your shadow
When everyday I see time goes by
In my head everything stood stillI'm waiting for things to unfreeze
Till you release me from the ice block
It's been floating for ages washed up by the sea
And it's drowning, thought you should know thatStill everyday I think about you
I know for a fact that's not your problem
But if you change your mind you'll find me
Hanging on to the place
Where the big blue sky collapseYou see people are trying
To find their way back home
So I'll find my way to youStill everyday I think about you
I know for a fact that's not your problem
But if you change your mind you'll find me
Hanging on to the place
Where the big blue sky
Still everyday I think about you
I know for a fact that's not your problem
But if you change your mind you'll find me
Hanging on to the place
Where the big blue sky collapse
