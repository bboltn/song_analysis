Orange Colored Sky
I was walking along
Mindin' my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, Bam, AlakazamWonderful you came by
I was hummin' a tune
Drinkin' in sunshine
When out of that orange colored viewFlash, Bam, Alakazam
I got a look at you.
One look and I yelled "timber"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in
And the bottom fell out
I went in to a spinAnd i started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it"I was walking alongMindin' my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, Bam, AlakazamOut of the orange colored skyWell, one look and I yelled "timber"
Watch out for flying glass'Cause the ceiling fell in
And the bottom fell outI went in to a spinAnd i started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I've been hit"
I was walkin' along
Mindin' my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, Bam, Alakazam
Out of that orange colored
Purple striped
Pretty green polka-dot sky
Flash, Bam, Alakazam...
And goodbye
