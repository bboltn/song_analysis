You Sigh
So few cares, and ever so unprepared
My mind is still not made up
You sigh, there's so much I could have said
You tried, and keep strong
You sigh, there's so much I could have said
But I wasn't ready then, and I'm still notYou sigh, there's so much I could have said
Don't cry, all day long
You sigh, there's so much I could have said
but I wasn't ready then, and I'm still not.
