Faded
You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
AlightWhere are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of meI'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm fadedThese shallow waters never met
What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
AliveWhere are you now?
Where are you now?Under the bright
But faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?Where are you now?Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of meI'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
