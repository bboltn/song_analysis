Caravan
Night and stars above that shine so bright
The myst'ry of their fading light
That shines upon our caravanSleep upon my shoulder as we creep
Across the sand so I may keep
This mem'ry of our caravanThis is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
As I thrill to the magic charmsOf you beside me here, beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravanNight, night, night, night and stars above that shine so bright
The myst'ry of their fading light
That shines upon our caravanSleep upon my shoulders as we creep
Across the sand so I may keep
This mem'ry of our caravanThis is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
As I thrill to the magic charmsOf you beside me here, beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravanYou beside me here, beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan
