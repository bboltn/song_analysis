Nevermind
Alright, I'm ready now
I ain't gonna fall back down now
Alright, I'll take it on me
All I ever ask is
'Are you gonna be my lover, tonight?'
and take it with meWhat if I left and it made no sense-
and you tell your friends-
and they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind. nevermind.Alright, I'm ready now
I ain't gonna stop right now, no
Alright, I'll take it on me
All I ever ask is
'Do you wanna see my fire, tonight?'
and take it with meWhat if I left and it made no sense-
and you tell your friends-
and they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind. nevermind.
