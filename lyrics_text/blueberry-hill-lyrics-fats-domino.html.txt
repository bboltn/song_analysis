Blueberry Hill
I found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found youThe moon stood still
On Blueberry Hill
And lingered until
My dream came trueThe wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to beThough we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry HillThe wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were only to be
Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
