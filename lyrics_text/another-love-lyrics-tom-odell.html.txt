Another Love
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care,
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils, in a pretty string,
But they won't flower like they did last springAnd I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright,
I'm just so tired to share my nights,
I wanna cry and I wanna love
but all my tears have been used upOn another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love another love,
All my tears have been used upAnd if somebody hurts you I wanna fight,
But my hands been broken, one too many times
So I use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll loseAnd I'll sing a song, that'd be just ours,
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry I wanna learn to love,
But all my tears have been used upOn another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up.And I'll sing a song, that'd be just ours,
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry I wanna fall in love,
But all my tears have been used upOn another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up.
