[Chorus]
Had to have high high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high high hopes
Had to have high high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high high hopes[Verse 1]
Mama said
Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater
Go make a legacy
Manifest destiny
Back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said
Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history
Light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories
Everyday
We wanted everything, wanted everything[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and i hate to see you waiting[Chorus]
Had to have high high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high high hopes
Had to have high high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high high hopes[Verse 1]
Mama said
It's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusades
Ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties
Don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and i hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me, eh eh eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see, eh eh eh[Chorus]
Had to have high high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high high hopesHad to have high high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feelingI was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high high hopes
