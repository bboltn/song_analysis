I Just Want To Be Where You Are
I just want to be where you are
Dwelling daily in your presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where you areI just want to be where you are
In your dwelling place forever
Take me to the place where you are
'cause I just want to be with youI want to be where you are
Dwelling in your presence
Feasting at your table
Surrounded by your glory
In your presence
That's where I always want to be
I just want to be
I just want to be with youI just want to be where you are
To enter boldly in you presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where you areO my God, you are my strength and my song
And when I'm in your presence
Though I'm weak You're always strong(repeat verse i)I just want to be where you are
In your dwlling place forever
Take me to the place where you are
'cause i just want to be
I just want to be with you
I just want to be
I just want to be with you
I just want to be
I just want to be with you
