I Need A Miracle
If you're gonna save the day
And you're hearin' what I say
I feel your touch
Your kiss, it's not enough
And if you believe in me
Don't think my love's for free
I won't take nothin' less then a deeper love[Chorus]
Let me tell you
You, no I,
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
Its more than physical
What I need to feel from youLet me tell youYou, no I,
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
Its more than physical
What I need to get me through[Chorus]Tell me that you understand
And you'll take me as I am
You'll always be the one to give me everything
Just when I thought no one cared
You're the answer to my prayers
You lift my spirits high
Come on and rescue me[Chorus]
