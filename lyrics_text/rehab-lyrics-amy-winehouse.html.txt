Rehab
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, goI'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. HathawayI didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glassThey tried to make me go to rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, goThe man said "Why you think you here?"
I said "I got no idea"
"I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby"
"So I always keep a bottle near"He said "I just think you're depressed"
"Kiss me, here baby, and go rest"They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, knowI don't ever want to drink again
I just, ooh I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
And have everyone think I'm on the mendAnd it's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab
But won't go, go, go!
