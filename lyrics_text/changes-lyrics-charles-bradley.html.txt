Changes
I feel unhappy
I feel so sad
I lost the best friend
That I ever hadShe was my woman
I loved her so
But it's too late now
I've let her goI'm going through changes
I'm going through changesWe shared the eve's
We shared each day
In love together
We found a wayBut soon the world
Had its evil way
My heart was blinded
Love went astrayI'm going through changes
I'm going through changesIt took so long
To realize
That I can still hear
Her last goodbyes
Now all my days
Are filled with tears
Wish I could go back
And change these years
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
