Friends
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooYou say you love me, I say you're crazy
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother
I know you since we were like ten, yeahDon't mess it up, talking that stuff
Only gonna push me away, that's it
When you say you love me, that make me crazy
Here we go again
Don't go looking me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 thousand timesHaven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?

Turning up at my door
It's 2 in the morning, the rain is pouring
Haven't we been here before?Don't mess it up, talking that stuff
Only gonna push me away, that's it
Have you got no shame, you looking insane
Here we go again
So don't go looking me with that look in your eye
