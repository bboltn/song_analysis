Riptide
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh all my friends are turning green
You're the magicians assistant in their dreams.
Awooo
Awooo
And they come unstuckLady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you, when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'causeYou're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
Awooo
Awooo
And they come unstuckLady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song andI got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other wayI swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, ohLady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrongOh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrongOh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
