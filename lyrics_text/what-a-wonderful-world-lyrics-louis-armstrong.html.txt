What A Wonderful World
I see trees of green
Red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and for you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful worldI see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful worldThe colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going byI see friends shaking hands
Saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying
"I love you"I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh yeah
