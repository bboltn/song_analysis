Killing Me Killing You
Baby, have you seen, there is a snake in our paradise
A serpent that's wriggling between us
and freezing our feelings to iceAnd with each drop of blood we bleed because of this
something so precious dies and it feels it really is...Killing Me Killing You
Killing all we have
As our loves wither awayBurning Me Burning You
Burning us to ash
Drowning us in a sea of flamesDarling, do you feel, there is a storm coming our way
The burning light between us is already starting to fade
And with each drop of blood our shattered hearts ever bleed
something so precious dies and is lost eternallyKilling Me Killing You
Killing all we haveAs our loves wither away
Burning Me Burning You
Burning us to ashDrowning us in a sea of flames
Each teardrop from your eyes
makes something inside me dieEach of these days that draws us part
takes a piece from my heart
Kill me kill me kill me again with your love
and chase the storm awayBring me bring me bring me the end with your love
and haunt the demons away
Killing Me Killing You
Killing all we haveAs our loves wither away
Burning Me Burning You
Burning us to ash
Drowning us in a sea of flames
Killing me, killing you
killing all we have
As our love withers away
Burning me, burning you
Burning us to ash
Drowning us in a sea of flames
Kill me, kill me, kill me again with your love and chase the snake away
Bring me, bring me, bring me the end with your love and haunt the demons away
