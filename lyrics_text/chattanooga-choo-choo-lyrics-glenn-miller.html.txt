Chattanooga Choo Choo
(Hey there Tex, what you say?)Step aside partner, it's my day
Bend an ear and listen to my version
(Of a really solid Tennisee excursion)Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
(Yes yes, track 29)
Boy, you can give me a shine
(Can you afford to board Chattanooga Choo Choo?)I've got my fare
(And just a trifle to spare)You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
(Then to have your ham and eggs in Carolina)When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennisee is not very far
Shuffle all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
(Whoo whoo, Chattanooga, there you are)There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and Lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam
(So Chattanooga Choo Choo)Won't you choo choo me home
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga)
Get aboard
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga)
All aboard
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga)Chattanooga Choo Choo
Won't you choo choo me home
Chattanooga Choo Choo
