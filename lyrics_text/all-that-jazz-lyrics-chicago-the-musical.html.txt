All That Jazz
Come on, babe
Why don't we paint the town?
And all that jazzI'm gonna rouge my knees
And roll my stockings down
And all that jazzStart the car
I know a whoopee spot
Where the gin is cold
But the piano's hot!It's just a noisy hall
Where there's a nightly brawl
And all that jazzAnd all that jazzAnd all that jazzSlick your hair
and wear your buckle shoes
And all that jazzI hear that Father Dip
Is gonna blow the blues
And all that jazz,Hold on, hon'
We're gonna bunny hug
I bought some aspirin
Down at United DrugIn case you shake apart
And wanna brand new start
To do that- jazz!Find a flask
We're playing fast and loose
And all that jazzRight up here
Is where I store the juice
And all that jazzCome on, babe
We're gonna brush the sky
I betcha Lucky Lindy
never flew so high'Cause in the stratosphere
How could he lend an ear
To all that jazz?Oh, you're gonna see your
Sheba shimmy shake
And all that jazzOh, she's gonna shimmy
Till her garters break
And all that jazzShow her where to park her girdle
Oh, her mother's blood'd curdle
(If she'd hear her baby queer)
For all that jazzAll that jazzCome on, babe
Why don't we paint the town?
And all that jazz
(And all that jazz)I'm gonna rouge my knees
And roll my stockings down
And all that jazz
(And all that jazz)Start the car
I know a whoopee spot
Where the gin is cold
But the piano's hot!It's just a noisy hall
Where there's a nightly brawl
And all that jazzNo, I'm no one's wife
But, oh, I love my life
And all that jazz
That jazz
