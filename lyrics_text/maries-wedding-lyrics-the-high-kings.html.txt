Marie's Wedding
Chorus:
Step we gaily, on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
Arm in arm and row on row
All for Mairi's wedding(Chorus)Over hillways up and down
Myrtle green and bracken brown
Past the shielings through the town
All for sake of Mairi(Chorus)Red her cheeks as rowans are
Bright her eyes as any star
Fairest of them all by far
Is our darling Mairi(Chorus 2x)Oh plenty herring, plenty meal
Plenty peat to fill her creel
Plenty bonny bairns as well
That's the toast for Mairi(Chorus 6x)
