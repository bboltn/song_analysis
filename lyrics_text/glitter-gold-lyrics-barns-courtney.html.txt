Glitter & Gold
I am flesh and I am bone
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter and gold
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter
Like glitter and gold
Like glitterDo you walk in the valley of kings?
Do you walk in the shadow of men?
who sold their lives to a dream?
Do you ponder the manner of things,
in the dark
the dark, the dark, the darkI am flesh and I am bone
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter
Like glitter and gold
Like glitterDo you walk in the meadow of spring?
Do you talk to the animals?
Do you hold their lives from a string?
Do you ponder the manner of things
in the dark
the dark, the dark, the darkI am flesh and I am bone.
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter
I am flesh and I am bone.
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter'Cause everybody in the backroom's
spinning up
Don't know what you're asking for
And everybody's in the front room's
tripping out
You left your bottle at the door.'Cause everybody in the backroom's
spinning up
Don't know what you're asking for
And everybody in the front room's

You left your bottle at the doorI am flesh and I am bone.
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
