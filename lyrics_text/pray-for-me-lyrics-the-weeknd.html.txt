Pray for Me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oohI'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all aloneWho gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, heyI fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a living Hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aiding relief
Earthquake, the body drop, the ground breaks
The poor one with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go he, heroMass destruction and mass corruption
Their souls are sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is coming
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good, then that's what it gotta beWho gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, heyHey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, heyWho gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, heyJust in case my finger roll
I live by my own, no
I live by my own, no
I live by my own
Just in case my finger roll
I live by my own, no
I live by my own, no
I live by my own
