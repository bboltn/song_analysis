The Perfect World
Someday l'll be gone
to somewhere that we belong
and god has never played his role
cause i'm the one who saves my soul
it's a perfect world we're longing for...
so longsomeday l'll be gone
to somewhere we all belong
and god has never played his role
cause i'm the one who saves my soul
it's a perfect world we're longing for...
won't youshow me the light?
how far you will go?
a vengeance to this wasted world that we know
to sleep in silence
we need to laugh againsomeday l'll be gone
to somewhere we all belong
and god has never played his role
cause i'm the one who saves my soul
it's a perfect world we're longing for...
so long
