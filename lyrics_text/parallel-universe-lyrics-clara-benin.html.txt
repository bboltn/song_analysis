Parallel Universe
It doesn't seem to make sense
Everything was going well
Guess that was just the surface
Cause underneath I could tell
No, I couldn't. I couldn't tellHe was my brightest star
In the night I couldn't ignore
Cause when he plays his guitar
He knows exactly where to go
He takes the lead and I followAimlessly I follow.In a parallel universe
Everything in reverse
Maybe you could be mine
In a parallel universe
Where timing is kind to us
Maybe we would be alrightI put myself to blame
I let you get away
But I feel (equally bad)
I close my eyes, I flashback
And just like that, I relapsedHelplessly I relapsedIn a parallel universe
Everything in reverse
Maybe you could be mine
In a parallel universe
Where timing is kind to us
Maybe would be alrightIn parallel universe
Maybe you'd be my first
I could be your only one
Oh this universe is a curse
Where's timing so cruel to us
I don't know how to be alrightDon't want to live in world where you are not mine
