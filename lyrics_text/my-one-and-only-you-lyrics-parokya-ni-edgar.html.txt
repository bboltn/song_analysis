Your Song (My One and Only You)
It took
One look
Then forever laid out in front of meOne smile
Then I died
Only to be revived by youThere I was
Thought I had everything figured out
Goes to show just how much I know
'Bout the way life, plays outchorus:
I take one step away
Then I find myself coming back
To you
My one and only you
One and only you
OhhhohhhNow I know
That I know not a thing at all
'Cept the fact that I am yours
And that you are mineOhhh
They told me that this wouldn't be easy
And no
I'm not one to complainrepeat chorus:(2 times)
I take one step away
Then I find myself coming back
To you
My one and only
One and onlyI take one step away
And I find myself coming back
To you
My one and only
One and only you.
