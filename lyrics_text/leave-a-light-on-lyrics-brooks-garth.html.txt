Leave a Light On
I lost my way but found today some body needed me
Needed me to open up the door closed before
That's what I here for
Now could you help me find my way back home?So leave a light on
Leave a light on for me and I will shine
And maybe then I can see you are my destiny
You and I keepin' love alive till the last tear is criedFor all time you're a friend of mine and I want to thank you
I thank you for always being there
Anywhere for only fools would dare
And now here I am my friend reaching out my hand, needing you againTo leave a light on
Leave a light on for me, so I will shine
And maybe then I can see that you are my destiny
You and I keep a love alive till the last tear is criedSo leave a light on
Leave a light on for me, I will shine
And maybe then I can see that you are my destiny
You and I keep a love alive till the last tear is criedLeave a light on
Leave a light on
And maybe then I can see that you are my destiny
