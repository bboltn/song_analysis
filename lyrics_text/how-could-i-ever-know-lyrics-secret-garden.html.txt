How Could I Ever Know
How could I know I would have to leave you?
How could I know I would hurt you so?
You were the one I was born to love
Oh, how could I ever know?
How could I ever know?How can I say to go on without me?
How, when I know you still need me so?
How can I say not to dream about me?
How could I ever know?
How could I ever know?Forgive me, can you forgive me?
And hold me in your heart
And find some new way to love me
Now that we're apart?How could I know I would never hold you?
Never again in this world
But oh, sure as you breathe I am there inside you
How could I ever know?
How could I ever know?How can I hope to go on without you?
How can I know where you'd have me go?
How can I bear not to dream about you?
Oh, how can I let you go?
How could I ever know?All I need is there in the garden
All I would ask is care for the child of our love
Come, go with me, safe I will keep you
Where you would lead me, there I would
There I would, there we would, there we will goOh! How could I know?
Tell me how could I know?
Never to know you would ever leave me
How could we ever know?
How could we know?
How could I ever know?
