Change Lanes
[Intro]
Been through a lot of pain in my life, and I pray the lord take it all away
I got family going through life never see the sunshine again and pray it all awayWe all the way![Hook]
Diamond teeth when I bless the game
I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, Cocaine great
Made a statement, I was grinding on 'em, wanna replay
Rolex no diamonds in it, twist movin' no time ticking'
Introverted, not trying' to kick it, private life, please mind your business
Introverted, these days
Introverted, these days
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane I done changed lanes
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane I done changed lanes[Verse 1]
[?], I ain't miss a beat, praise to Allah, made it out the clink
Alhamdulillah, praise be to God
Big booty freak, givin' her massage
Lookin' in the mirror, looking' at a star
She get on her knees knees, look up at a star
Remember being broke, wishin' on a star
I remember no one giving us a star
White gold, iced out, [?]
Foreign car, push button, auto start
Rest and relaxation, not involved
Goin' hard Rolls Royce, R&R;
Wonder why these niggas hate me
Probably 'cause they know they ain't me
I ain't never been a gang member, Illinois labeled me a gang chief
[?] Judge bein' racist, [?] wrongful conviction
[?] lied to me, gave him a quarter ticket
Laying in my cell, looking at the ceiling, I'ma love the vision and all the killers throwing shit and pissing [?][Hook]
Diamond teeth when I bless the game
I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, Cocaine great
Made a statement, I was grinding on 'em, wanna replay
Rolex no diamonds in it, twist movin' no time ticking'
Introverted, not trying' to kick it, private life, please mind your business
Introverted, these days
Introverted, these days
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane I done changed lanes
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane I done changed lanes[Verse 2]
(Vroom Vroom) It's a Camaro, I'm rocking [?] fitness apparel [?]
Pardon me ma'am I'm the man with some answers not making plans that was made to be cancelled coulda said how you doing I'm kinda bashful why you willing to fuck with me why you staring?
Got some real niggas
Overseas when I travel McLerran come to think this was me
Politic'n with family I got status tryna
Making music
Word to God ima fuck a Kardashian[Hook]
Diamond teeth when I bless the game
I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, Cocaine great
Made a statement, I was grinding on 'em, wanna replay
Rolex no diamonds in it, twist movin' no time ticking'
Introverted, not trying' to kick it, private life, please mind your business
Introverted, these days
Introverted, these days
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane I done changed lanes
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane I done changed lanes
