If I Had a Heart
This will never end
'Cause I want more
More, give me more
Give me moreThis will never end
'Cause I want more
More, give me more
Give me moreIf I had a heart I could love you
If I had a voice I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow bringsAhhhhhhh Ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhh Ahhhhhhh
If I had a voice, I would singDangling feet from window frame
Will I ever ever reach the floor?
More, give me more, give me moreCrushed and filled with all I found
Underneath and inside
Just to come around
More, give me more, give me moreAhhhhhhh (Ahh) Ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhh (Ahhhh) Ahhhhhhh
If I had a voice, I would sing
