Melody Of A Murder
Turn the lights off,
I want to know, what's going on
in the Black show.
Inside the room, playing for you,
she makes a new move.
Smiling at me, she stops to see
why her new boy is sitting with this
Person right here
The ugly queen
She should have gone
But what she doesn't know
is that I'm the girl of her boy's dreams
Even when he's alone
Even when I'm goneHe thinks of me.
After the ring, she talks to me
As we are friends, I know something
Weird is happening inside her mind
Should I ask?
Maybe she found out what her boyfriendand I haveProbably it's me, should take some sleep
Before I act
But what I didn't know
is that I was the girl
of her nightmares
Even when she's alone
Even when I'm gone
She wants my bloodIncredibly, I have found where I belong to
It's almost a dream, I can't hear a thingHe belongs to me, sing for it
A twisted fate, a burning feeling inside...It's almost a dream, he belongs to me...
And that night, picks a knife
Comes to my room, comes to my room
While I sleep, looks at meI hate you girl, I hate you girl
Sorry you, butterfly
Gon' cut your wings, gon' cut your wings
The knife inside my heart
Now he only, belongs to me!
