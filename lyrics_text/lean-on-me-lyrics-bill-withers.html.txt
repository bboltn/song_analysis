Lean On Me
Hmm... hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm

Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain
We all have sorrowBut if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrowLean on me
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on...For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need somebody to lean onPlease swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrowFor no one can fill
Those of your needs that you won't let showYou just call on me brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean onI just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean onLean on me
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on...For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need somebody to lean onYou just call on me brother
When you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean onI just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean onIf there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carryI'm right up the road
I'll share your load
