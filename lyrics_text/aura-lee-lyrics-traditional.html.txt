Aura Lee
1. As the blackbird in the spring
'neath the willow treesat and piped
I heard him sing
praising Aura Lee.
Aura Lee! Aura Lee! Maid of golden hairsunshine came along with thee and swall-ows in the air.2. Take my heart and take my ring
I give my all to theetake me for eternity
dearest Aura Lee!
Aura Lee ! Aura Lee! Maid of golden hairSunshine came along with thee and swall-ows in the air3. In her blush the rose was born
'twas music when she spokein her eyes
the light of morn
sparkling seemed to break.
Aura Lee! Aura Lee . . .4. Aura Lee
the bird may flee. the willow' golden hair...then the wintry winds may be. blowing ev'rywhere.
Yet if thy blue eyes I see
gloom. will soon, departfor to me
sweet Aura Lee. is sunshine to the heart.
