Taste
Slide on a pimp game with my pinky rang
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You don't even got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rocking it like its fresh off the pan
Only when I'm taking pics, I'm the middle man
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift the hand
3 million cash, call me rain man
Money like a shower, thats my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's gang land
Say the wrong word, you be hang man
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
Aw, Mr. what kind of car you in?

And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C
Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team
And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream
And my bitch want the Fenty not the Maybelline

Diamond ice glacier niggas imitate
Aye, aye feed me grapes Maybach with the drac'
Slow case in the wraith, got this shit from bae
Diamonds set the par, the cookie hittin' hard
The rari sittin' hard, I'm [?] on mars
Shotgun shells we gon' always hit the target
Popcorn bitch shell poppin' out the car trick
3400 outside [?]
488, Ferrari
Make her get on top of me and ride me like a Harley
She wanna keep me company and never want depart me
Fishtail in the parking lot
I don't kick it with these niggas cause they talk about cha
And I got the fire don't make me spark it out cha
Keep it in my back pocket like it's a wallet

Stack it up and put it with the whole project
And she got the Patek on water [?]
