Nowadays
It's good
Isn't it grand? Isn't it great?
Isn't it swell? Isn't it fun?
Isn't it? NowadaysThere's men
Everywhere jazz, everywhere booze
Everywhere life, everywhere joy
Everywhere, nowadaysYou can like the life you're livin'
You can live the life you like
You can even marry Harry
But mess around with Ike
And that's goodIsn't it grand? Isn't it great?
Isn't it swell? Isn't it fun?Ladies and gentlemen, the Chicago theater
Is proud to announce a first
The first time, anywhere there has been an act of this nature
Not only one little lady but two!
You've read about them in the papers
And now here they are
Chicago's own killer, dillers those two scintillating sinners
Roxie Hart and Velma KellyYou can like the life you're livin'
You can live the life you like
You can even marry Harry
But, mess around with Ike
And that's goodIsn't it grand? Isn't it great?
Isn't it swell? Isn't it fun?
Isn't it?But nothing stays in fifty years or so
It's gonna change, you know
But oh, it's heaven
