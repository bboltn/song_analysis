At the starting of the week
At summit talks, you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday.
(Mahmut Orhan - 6 days)Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day.Tomorrow never comes until it's too late.You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday.
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw

It's April Fools day.Tomorrow never comes until it's too late.We'll all go running underground
And we'll be listening for the sound
It's only Wednesday.In your shelter, dimly lit,
Take some wool and learn to knit
'Cause it's a long day.Tomorrow never comes until it's too late.You'll hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday.You feel the shaking of the ground
A million candles burn around
Is it your birthday?Tomorrow never comes until it's too late.Although that shelter is your home
Correction: A living space you have outgrown
It's only Friday.As you come out to the light,
Can your eyes behold the sight?
It must be Doomsday!Tomorrow never comes until it's too late.Ain't it funny how men think
They made the bomb, they are extinct
It's only Saturday.I think tomorrow's come, I think it's too late
I think tomorrow's come, I think it's too late
Think tomorrow's come, I think it's too lateee.
