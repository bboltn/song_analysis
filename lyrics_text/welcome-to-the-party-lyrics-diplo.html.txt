Welcome To The Party
[Intro: French Montana]
Step up in the party, step up in the party hot
Ride up to the party, ride up to the party hot[Chorus: French Montana & Zhavia Ward]
Welcome to the party (live it up)
Welcome to the party, aye
Welcome to the party, aye
Welcome to the party[Verse: French Montana]
Hit 'em up, get 'em up
Put 'em up, we wakin' up
Fly with my dogs, ridin' high when we pull up
Fly with my dogs, ridin' high when we pull up
When we ride, when we pull up
We be high, when we pull up
Coupe with the top down, no ceilin'
Rocks on the watch now, armageddon
Roof on fire, fire
We ride, ride
Pull up in a tank, bow-bow
Yeah, on Ciroc, in the drop, full of [?]
Yeah, we the squad, 100 cars full of [?]
Yeah, I pull up with [?], yeah especially [?] and vanilla
Roof on fire, we be higher like a [?]
Shawty bad, call it MJ Thriller
Welcome to the party, sippin' on the Act
Pull up in a 'Rari, DJ bring it back
Fell in love with shawty, money like Shaq
Welcome to the party[Chorus: French Montana, Zhavia Ward & Lil Pump ]
Welcome to the party, (welcome to the party)
Welcome to the party, aye, (welcome to the party)

Essketit[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
I can't feel my body, 'cause I pop a lot of molly
Welcome to the party, bitch I'm 'bout to catch a body
Bitch I'm in the shit, we don't give a fuck about it
Bitch I start a riot, bitch I'm 'bout to start a riot
Welcome to the trap, got my grandma sellin' crack
I make [?], you make it when you sittin' down just movin' packs
Make a bitch do jumpin' jacks like she was an acrobat
Got these bitches lookin' at me crazy 'cause I got face tats
Ooh, drip, drip, drip, I cannot go away for a bitch
Drop 5 million on my crib, now Lil Pump is rich as shit, ooh
And I'm still on probation, pop a pill I feel amazing
You just bluffin', you just hatin'
All these diamonds on me skatin'
Man I do this every day, spend three thousand on some shades
I got bitches in L.A., your boyfriends broke, his diamonds fake[Chorus: French Montana & Zhavia Ward]
Welcome to the party, (welcome to the party)
Welcome to the party, aye, (welcome to the party)
Welcome to the party, aye, (welcome to the party)
Welcome to the party, (welcome to the party)
Welcome to the party, (welcome to the party)
Welcome to the party, aye, (welcome to the party)
Welcome to the party, aye, (welcome to the party)
