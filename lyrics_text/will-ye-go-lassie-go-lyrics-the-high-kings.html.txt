Will Ye Go Lassie, Go?
Oh, the summertime is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie, go?CHORUS:And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie, go?I will build my love a bower
Near yon pure crystal fountain
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain
Will ye go lassie, go?CHORUSIf my true love she were gone
I would surely find another
Where wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie, go?CHORUSOh, the summertime is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie, go?CHORUS
