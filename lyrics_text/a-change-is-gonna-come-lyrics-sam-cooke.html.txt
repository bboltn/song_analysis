A Change Is Gonna Come
I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, and just like the river I've been running ever sinceIt's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come, oh yes it willIt's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the skyIt's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come, oh yes it willI go to the movie and I go down town
Somebody keep telling me don't hang aroundIt's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come, oh yes it willThen I go to my brother
And I say, "Brother, help me please."
But he winds up knockin' me
Back down on my kneesThere been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry onIt's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come, oh yes it will
