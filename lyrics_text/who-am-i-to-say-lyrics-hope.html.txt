Who Am I To Say
Love of my life, my soulmate
You're my best friend
Part of me like breathing
Now half of me is leftI don't know anything at all
Who am I to say you love me
I don't know anything at all
And who am I to say you need meColor me blue I'm lost in you
Don't know why I'm still waiting
Many moons have come and gone
Don't know why I'm still searchingDon't know anything at all
And who am I to say you love me
I don't know anything at all
And who am I to say you need meHmmm hmmm mmm
Uhhh oohhh aahhhHooo aahhh ohh ohhhNow you're a song I love to sing
Never thought it'd feel so free
Now I know what's meant to be
And that's okay with meBut who am I to say you love me
And who am I to say you need me
And who am I to say you love meMmmm Hmmm
I don't know anything at all
And who am I to say you love me
I don't know anything at all
And who am I to say you need me
I don't know anything at all
I don't know anything at all
I don't know anything at all
I don't know anything at all
