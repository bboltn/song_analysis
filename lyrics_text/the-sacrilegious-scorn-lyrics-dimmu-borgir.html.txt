The Sacrilegious Scorn
Have I not
Been too long in the shadows of invention and creation
As I rightfully behold the flesh
Fear of the conscious mind will have you facing awayMy word and world holds ground and is real
Your word is like floods of poisoned water
A language spoken with spit from different tonguesIt all seems like an eternity
This battle between us two
"Good and evil"
Me and youTime has come to step up
And take back what you took from meMy word and world holds ground and is real
Your word is like floods of poisoned water
A language spoken with spit from different tongues
You can never corrupt me againTime has come to step up
And take back what you took from me
You can never corrupt me againI protect every man guilty of sin
The ultimate sin being me
The vapor from the plague
That infested my mind, body and soul
Obscured my view from wisdom
The mist that had me wonder in resentment cleared
And troubles me no more
