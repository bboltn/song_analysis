Home
Thinking back when we first met
I remember what you said
You said you'd never leave me
I let go of your hand
Built my castle in the sand
But now I'm reachin' out again
And I'm not letting go
Till you
Hold me
Mold me
Sometimes I feel so all alone
See I gotta find my way back home
So why don't you
Shape me
Make me
Wash me whiter than the snow
I gotta find my way
Back homeMaster upon my knees I pray
I just want to be the clay
Put your arms around me
Place my life in your hands
Lord I know I'm just a man
I know you understand
This time I'm not letting goTill youAnoint me
Appoint me
Sometimes I feel so all alone
See I gotta find my way back home
So why don't you
Chastise me
Baptize meWash me whiter than the snow
I gotta find my way'Cause I'm lost and alone
I've been wanderingLong enough to know
Humbly I search for you
And I'm not gonna rest till youChoose me
Use me
Sometimes I feel so all alone
I'm on my way back home
So why don't you
Direct me
Bless me
Wash me whiter than the snow
I'm on my way
Back home
