You've Lost That Loving Feeling
You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it, [(baby)]
But baby, baby I know itYou've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone... gone... gone... woahNow there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And now you're starting to criticize the things I do
It makes me just feel like crying [(baby)]
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dyingYou lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone... gone... gone... woahBaby baby, I get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip awayBaby (baby), baby (baby)
I beg of you please... please,
I need your love (I need your love),
I need your love (I need your love),
Well, bring it on back (So bring it on back),
Bring it on back (so bring it on back).Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'

'Cause it's gone... gone... gone
And I can't go on, woahBring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
