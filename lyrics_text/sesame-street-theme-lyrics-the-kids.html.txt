Sesame Street Theme
Sunny Day
Sweepin' the clouds away
On my way to where the air is sweet
Can you tell me how to get?
How to get to Sesame StreetCome and play
Everything's A-OK
Friendly neighbors there
That's where we meet

How to get to Sesame StreetIt's a magic carpet ride
Every door will open wide
To happy people like you
Happy people like
What a beautiful
Sunny Day
Sweepin' the clouds away
On my way to where the air is sweet
Can you tell me how to get,
