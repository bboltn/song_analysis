Beer Barrel Polka (Roll Out The Barrel)
In a garden, what a garden
Only happy faces bloom there
And there's never any room there
For a worry or a gloom thereOh, there's music and there's dancing
And a lot of sweet romancing
When they play the polka
They all get in the swingEvery time they hear that oom-pa-pa
Everybody feels so tra-la-la
They want to throw their cares away
They all go lah-de-ah-de-ayThen they hear a rumble on the floor, the floor
It's the big surprise they're waiting for
And all the couples form a ring
For miles around you'll hear them singRoll out the barrel, we'll have a barrel of fun
Roll out the barrel, we've got the blues on the run
Zing boom tararrel, ring out a song of good cheer
Now's the time to roll the barrel, for the gang's all hereDa-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-daThen they hear a rumble on the floor-or-or-or
It's the big surprise they're waiting for
And all the couples, they form a ring
For miles around you'll hear them singDree mopado theedo da-da-da-daRoll it out, roll it out, roll out the barrel
Da-da-da da-da da-da da-da-da-da-da
Sing a song of good cheer, 'cause the whole gang is here
Roll it out, roll it out, let's do the Beer Barrel Polka
