At Last
At Last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a songOhh yeah yeah
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart as wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at youI found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to rest my cheek to
A thrill that I have never knownOhh yeah yeah
You smile
You smile
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At Last
