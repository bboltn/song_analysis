Nobody Knows It But Me
I pretend that I'm glad you went away
These four walls closing more every day
I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but meWhy didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I could see it so clearly but you're nowhere aroundThe nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but meI carry a smile when I'm broken in two
I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm trembling inside
And nobody knows it but me (yeah)I lay awake, it's a quarter past three
I'm screaming at night if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah, my heart is calling you
And nobody knows it but meHow blue could I get?
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be loving you stillThe nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but meOooo oohhhhh yeahTomorrow morning, I'm a hit a dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, wherever you might go
And I'm gonna unload my heart and hope you come back to meI said when the nights are lonely
The nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but meThe nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but meThe nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but me
