Lavender Blue (Dilly Dilly)
Lavender's blue, dilly dilly,
Lavender's green
When you are king, dilly dilly,
I shall be queenWho told you so, dilly dilly,
Who told you so?
'Twas my own heart, dilly dilly,
That told me soCall up your friends, dilly, dilly
Set them to work
Some to the plough, dilly dilly,
Some to the forkSome to the hay, dilly dilly,
Some to thresh corn
Whilst you and I, dilly dilly,
Keep ourselves warmLavender's blue, dilly dilly,
Lavender's green
When you are king, dilly dilly,
I shall be queenWho told you so, dilly dilly,
Who told you so?
'Twas my own heart, dilly dilly,
That told me so.
