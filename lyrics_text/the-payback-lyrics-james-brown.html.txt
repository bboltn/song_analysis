(The big payback)Sold me out for chicken change
You said my woman had it all arranged
Tried to make a deal, she wanted to squeal
But I had my boys on her heels
Saw what she had comin', told a lie,
she broke down and she wanted to cry
I don't care what she does
She'll be doing just like she was
Take those kids and raise them up
Somebody drink out the righteous cup
Take her, take that woman, it's one place she found
Just run that mother out of town
Make her get up, make her get up, get out
Make her get up, make her get up, get out
I'm mad!
I want revenge, I want revenge, my...
(The big payback)
My patience ends, I want revenge
My patience ends, I want revenge
I want revenge, I want revenge
(The big payback)
Gonna get some hits, I need those hits
I need those hits, hit me!Lord, I need those hits
Carry on, carry on, payback melody
(The big payback)
(The big payback)
Alright!
Da-dee-ra-da, da-dee-ra-da, da-dee-ra-da!
