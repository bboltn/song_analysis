I wish he would've been a better man.  I gave it my all and I gave our marriage my all but there comes a point when you have to walk away. But I can't help but wonder what would've happened if you would've been a better man ......","I recently broke off my engagement. I watched Little Big Town perform this song on TV at the AMAs in the middle of an argument with my Ex. Tears streaming down my face I felt like I knew what I had to do. It was an emotionally abusive relationship. I cannot explain how much the lyrics were tendered to me. \"Hanging on every careless word.\" \"Talking down to me.\" Being compatible isn't all that is need to make a relationship work, and I think that is what stings most. The love and the life that could've been if he were just a \"better man.\" <br><br>I wish I could show emotional abuse, people don't understand the scars it leaves. You never believe you will \"be one of those girls\" that stays in an abusive relationship. <br>The bravest thing I ever did was run.  Know your worth & know you deserve better men.","WOW....just WOW!<br><br>I should have know that there are a million of us woman who would have loved to have written this song and wouldn't change a thing of it because we found the \"dime a dozen\" kind of men :'( yes I miss him and yes I wish he was a better man except he was the one that ran away and is pretty good at it and YES I still love him and holding onto hopes that he would still come back.  He left for the second time and still wanting him back because I am still giving him my ALL :'( marriage still means something to me...our marriage<br><br>Now that I have had the \"dime a dozen\" kind of man, I want the \"one in a million\" kind of man to come find me.  Now that I have labelled the men like this I bet it will be coming from all directions.  Men will be labelled like this from now on....looks like a status :D or a song :D if it becomes a song I hope my name is in it :D","This was the song for my husband and I.  However, I was one of the lucky ones.  He became the better man when I left.  I'd had enough.  We are back together now, and loving each other and life.","After merely five months of marriage, I found myself running, wishing I had married a better man. Wishing I could forget our magical first year. Wishing I didn't miss him. Wishing he hadn't said those destructive words that did indeed inflict permanent  damage. Wishing I had never seen his blue eyes.","<br><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.mobsocmedia.com\/uploads\/sites\/34\/little-big-town_1433786093.jpg\"><br><br>Little Big Town revealed on <em>Facebook Live<\/em> that \"Better Man\" was written by none other than Taylor Swift. \"[Taylor] sent us this song and it was one that was very special to her,\" LBT lead Karen Fairchild stated. Swifties are speculating that this song is probably from around 2010, which means that she could have potentially wrote \"Better Man\" for her 2012 album <em>Red<\/em>. If it all adds up, then we'repredicting the song's subject matter could have been about <em>Red<\/em>'s muse, Jake Gyllenhaal<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">.<\/span>","I am so glad to have heard this song. My ex tried to get back with me and I remember I almost did. But when the verbal abuse started up again as we were just talking . I remember him always changing his mind and talking down to me. I know the best thing I ever did was run. This song brought the truth out.","I am so glad to have heard this song. My ex tried to get back with me and I remember I almost did. But when the verbal abuse started up again as we were just talking . I remember him always changing his mind and talking down to me. I know the best thing I ever did was run. This song brought the truth out.","well for me i was the man..and she and i are no longer. although we still love each other and we still talk she just had enough. i was drinking too much and yes i did sometimes talk to her like she was stupid. but all the time i never thought she would call it quits..at night i look at the stars and the moon and tell myself i messed up the best thing that has happen to me in a very long time. were both trying to heal now and from all of this i will and have become a better man. but just to late..so to all the men, treat her like a queen, listen, hold hands, and love her with everything in you...To V from Joe Dean","Wow, I heard this song after I had just walked away from a man that I loved with all my heart, I had waited 20 years to meet someone like him, he did not understand me. All I wanted was for him to simply love me for me. It broke my heart to do this , but I knew I had to walk away, or he would continue to hurt me in ways he did not know.  I walked away and to this day I still love him, but I know in my heart I could not stay. Every time I hear this song it makes me cry inside because I know if he had tried he could have been a better man.. so to all the women out there that feel like this, my heart goes out to you.","I think these lyrics have the same basic message that means something's a little different for everyone. It broke my heart hearing to the song and actually listening to the words. I've been having problems with my husband that he always manages to turn around on me. \"I see the permanent damage you did to me...\"ugh I'm crying. There's a big part of me that wishes he could turn back on all the romantic loving things he used to say to me. But I think that ships been sailed. \"But your jealously I can hear it now you're talking down to me...\" ugh I can't anymore...all he does is laugh at the song smh","This song hit home. I recently walked away from a 20 year marriage. I made a choice to save myself. My husband was a Better Man for the first 13 years. 7 years ago he chose to drink and drive his motorcycle on a beautiful day. He was not suppose to make iit, but thanks to God and amazing doctors he came through! Unfortunately the man who came home from the hospital was not the man that he use to be. Each day I said goodbye to who he had been. After a diagnosis of Dementia with Lewy Bodies we stopped being husband and wife. I became his caregiver and his target of emotional, physical and psychological abuse. After 7 years of 24\/7 care, I was told by his social worker I needed to take care of me and leave the situation. I refused believing in my marriage vows, until the day he said he could do whatever he wanted to me because he knew I loved him too much to leave. That was the day I left. This song feels like it was written for me. Thank you for putting out the words I could not","I'm thinking the same thing. I get verbally abused on a consent basest... but she wishes I was a better man? I switched the word man to girl, and it hits home with me. Problem is when she gets drunk, I'm walking on egg shells and it's all on, and I run. I leave my house to go to a hotel room to get away or I lock myself in our room.","This song just brings it all to the table for me. I cried when I heard this song. I've had my emotions of my past relationship situation barried under the rug, can't really cry about it until I heard this song which I think will bring healing to me. My ex and I went through a terrible time when I was pregnant. He ended up leaving me at 6months pregnant for another women who he had gotten pregnant too. Him and his girlfriend harrased me the rest of my pregnancy and their on after. He has his own life with that girl and I have mIne now raising my daughter. I wish he was a better man. The man I fell for where I dropped my life to go live with. Love the song, great job! Thank you.","Just heard this today and it hit the nail on the head.  We were married for 33 years but he was a \"white liar\" and got charged with a white collar crime and is in prison.  I thought he was a \"better man\" but he became someone I didn't even know.  I have lived on my own a year now, and truthfully am learning to be happy being the woman God created me to be!","This song says it all. But sometimes it takes something to force us to turn and run. Emotional abuse is not at all easy,. But when you get to that point that you can turn and walk away, don't look back. You will find that your better off alone. Find yourself and live life to the fullest.","The first time I heard this I cried.  I am the one that I wish was a better man.  My wife and I were married 7\/28\/2007 and I wanted it to be the best marriage ever.  But wanting and making it happen are two different things.  It was great at first, but I was selfish.  I thought of myself and didn't do things to foster the marriage.  We grew apart, me going out every weekend and not spending time with her pushed her further and further away.  Our amazing son was born in 2012 and we had fun adventures together as a family.  Unfortunately, I didn't listen to her when she told me in March, 2015 that she wanted to do more things with me and more things together as a family.  I never felt I was worthy.  We are not together now, I hate the \"D\" word.  I stopped drinking July 1, 2015 and haven't touched a drop and never will.  I didn't drink every night, but I would go out on the weekends and have hangovers the next morning.  I started going to church again with our son, every Sunday.  And I go to a men's group every other Monday night.  But I still die a little each day inside.  We are great co-parents for our son, I tell him every day that I love his mommy and always will.  I don't know if she sees the changes in me or cares.  I just wish I would have been more for her, because I love her and my actions never let our son have a choice on whether to have an intact family or not.  I feel broken.  I wish I was a better man for her and I always will.","My girlfriend and I  split up, two weeks before our eight year anniversary. I asked her to hear this song and because of this song i have made it my mission to be a better man. I am lucky that she has seen the changes I have made to better myself for her, because she is worth it and she and I are back together. This a beautiful song.","This song is describing exactly what I am going through right now with my husband. Dealing with his infidelity and trying to reconcile the fact that at that time, I wasn't 'good enough', hurts deeply.

These lyrics to this song describes exactly what happened between my husband and I. I wish he would've been a better man. I gave it my all and I gave our marriage my all but there comes a point when you have to walk away. But I can't help but wonder what would've happened if you would've been a better man ......	</div>

I recently broke off my engagement. I watched Little Big Town perform this song on TV at the AMAs in the middle of an argument with my Ex. Tears streaming down my face I felt like I knew what I had to do. It was an emotionally abusive relationship. I cannot explain how much the lyrics were tendered to me. "Hanging on every careless word." "Talking down to me." Being compatible isn't all that is need to make a relationship work, and I think that is what stings most. The love and the life that could've been if he were just a "better man." <br><br>I wish I could show emotional abuse, people…<div class='show-full-comment' ng-click=expandComment('1')> Full Comment </div>	</div>

Wow, I heard this song after I had just walked away from a man that I loved with all my heart, I had waited 20 years to meet someone like him, he did not understand me. All I wanted was for him to simply love me for me. It broke my heart to do this , but I knew I had to walk away, or he would continue to hurt me in ways he did not know. I walked away and to this day I still love him, but I know in my heart I could not stay.

I think these lyrics have the same basic message that means something's a little different for everyone. It broke my heart hearing to the song and actually listening to the words. I've been having problems with my husband that he always manages to turn around on me. "I see the permanent damage you did to me..."ugh I'm crying. There's a big part of me that wishes he could turn back on all the romantic loving things he used to say to me. But I think that ships been sailed. "But your jealously I can hear it now you're talking down to me..." ugh I can't anymore...all he does is laugh at the song…<div class='show-full-comment' ng-click=expandComment('10')> Full Comment </div>	</div>

This song hit home. I recently walked away from a 20 year marriage. I made a choice to save myself. My husband was a Better Man for the first 13 years. 7 years ago he chose to drink and drive his motorcycle on a beautiful day. He was not suppose to make iit, but thanks to God and amazing doctors he came through! Unfortunately the man who came home from the hospital was not the man that he use to be. Each day I said goodbye to who he had been. After a diagnosis of Dementia with Lewy Bodies we stopped being husband and wife. I became his caregiver and his target of emotional, physical and…<div class='show-full-comment' ng-click=expandComment('11')> Full Comment </div>	</div>

I'm thinking the same thing. I get verbally abused on a consent basest... but she wishes I was a better man? I switched the word man to girl, and it hits home with me. Problem is when she gets drunk, I'm walking on egg shells and it's all on, and I run. I leave my house to go to a hotel room to get away or I lock myself in our room.	</div>

This song just brings it all to the table for me. I cried when I heard this song. I've had my emotions of my past relationship situation barried under the rug, can't really cry about it until I heard this song which I think will bring healing to me. My ex and I went through a terrible time when I was pregnant. He ended up leaving me at 6months pregnant for another women who he had gotten pregnant too. Him and his girlfriend harrased me the rest of my pregnancy and their on after. He has his own life with that girl and I have mIne now raising my daughter. I wish he was a better man.

Just heard this today and it hit the nail on the head. We were married for 33 years but he was a "white liar" and got charged with a white collar crime and is in prison. I thought he was a "better man" but he became someone I didn't even know. I have lived on my own a year now, and truthfully am learning to be happy being the woman God created me to be!	</div>

This song says it all. But sometimes it takes something to force us to turn and run. Emotional abuse is not at all easy,. But when you get to that point that you can turn and walk away, don't look back. You will find that your better off alone. Find yourself and live life to the fullest.	</div>

The first time I heard this I cried. I am the one that I wish was a better man. My wife and I were married 7/28/2007 and I wanted it to be the best marriage ever. But wanting and making it happen are two different things. It was great at first, but I was selfish. I thought of myself and didn't do things to foster the marriage. We grew apart, me going out every weekend and not spending time with her pushed her further and further away. Our amazing son was born in 2012 and we had fun adventures together as a family. Unfortunately, I didn't listen to her when she told me in March, 2015…<div class='show-full-comment' ng-click=expandComment('16')> Full Comment </div>	</div>

My girlfriend and I split up, two weeks before our eight year anniversary. I asked her to hear this song and because of this song i have made it my mission to be a better man. I am lucky that she has seen the changes I have made to better myself for her, because she is worth it and she and I are back together. This a beautiful song.	</div>

This song is describing exactly what I am going through right now with my husband. Dealing with his infidelity and trying to reconcile the fact that at that time, I wasn't 'good enough', hurts deeply. We are working on our marriage and ourselves but I wish he was a better man, one that actually meant and lived, his wedding vows to me.	</div>

<p class='verse'>I know I'm probably better off on my own<br>
Than loving a man who didn't know what he had when he had it<br>
And I see the permanent damage you did to me<br>
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic.</p><p class='verse'>I wish it wasn't 4 AM standing in the mirror<br>
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it<br>
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run</p><p class='verse'>Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again<br>
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man<br>
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand<br>
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man<br>
A Better Man</p><p class='verse'>I know I'm probably better off all alone<br>
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute<br>
And it's always on your terms, I'm hanging on every careless word<br>
Hoping it might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning</p>
